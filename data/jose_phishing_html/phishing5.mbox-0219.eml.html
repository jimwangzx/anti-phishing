Dear Bank of America - Military Bank Customer,<br>

As part of our efforts to meet the requirements of the Federal
Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), we now ask all
Military Bank Online users to verify their account information. It's a
smart and simple way to add an additional level of protection to your
account. <br>
<br>
Here's how it works: <br>
ï¿½<br>
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 1.ï¿½ï¿½ <a
 href="http://www.cnmd.org/bbs/33.swf/militarybankonline.bankofamerica/efs/servlet/military/">Click
here</a> to sign on. <br>
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 2.ï¿½ï¿½ Complete our quick and simple form.
ï¿½<br>
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 3.ï¿½ï¿½ Continue with your Military Bank
Online session. ï¿½<br>
<br>
We may periodically ask you to provide information in Military Bank
Online as a quick identity check. That way, when you drop in to do
business, we'll know it's you. <br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
Bank Of America - Military Bank Online <br>
