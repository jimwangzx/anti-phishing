	We recently have determined that different computers have logged onto your online Citi Cards account, and multiple 
	password failures were present before the logons. We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us.<br><br>

	If this is not completed by <font color=red>September 22</font>, <font color=red>2007</font>, we will be forced to suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been
	used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner.<br><br><br>

	To confirm your account records click on the following link:<br>
