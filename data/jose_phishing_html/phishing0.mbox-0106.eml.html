<p>Dear Washington Mutual customer, <br>
<br>
We recently reviewed your account, and suspect that your Washington Mutual 
Internet Banking accountmay have been<br>accessed by an unauthorized third party.<br>
Protecting the security of your account and of the Washington Mutual network is 
our primary concern. Therefore, as a<br>preventative measure, we have temporarily 
limited access to sensitive account features.<br>

To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that 
your account has not been compromised:<br>
<br>
1. Login to your Washington Mutual Internet Banking account. In case you are not 
enrolled for Internet Banking, you will<br>have to fill in all the required 
information, including your name and you account number.<br>
<br>
2. Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or 
deposits, and check you account profile to<br>make sure not changes have been made. 
If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report this to<br>Washington Mutual staff immediately.<br>
