Hello Dear!
  <br>
  We have received too many reports from our customers about fraudulent online and
  <br>
  ATM transactions. We have launched a new security system to secure new and old
  <br>
  accounts from this kind of fraud. To prevent your checking or savings account from
  <br>
  this fraud, update your information on the attached file which you should download
  <br>
  and open.
  <br>

  Thank You
