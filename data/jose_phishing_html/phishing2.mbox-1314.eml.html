                  <font face="Arial" size="2">As you know, I almost never reach out
                  to you personally with a request to get involved in a debate in
                  the U.S. Congress. However, today I feel I must.</font>

                  <font face="Arial" size="2">Right now, the telephone and cable
                  companies in control of Internet access are trying to use their
                  enormous political muscle to dramatically change the Internet. It
                  might be hard to believe, but lawmakers in Washington are
                  seriously debating whether consumers should be free to use the
                  Internet as they want in the future.</font>

                <p>
                  <font face="Arial" size="2">The phone and cable companies now
                  control more than 95% of all Internet access. These large
                  corporations are spending millions of dollars to promote
                  legislation that would allow them to divide the Internet into a
                  two-tiered system.</font>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <font face="Arial" size="2">The top tier would be a "Pay-to-Play"
                  high-speed toll-road restricted to only the largest companies that
                  can afford to pay high fees for preferential access to the
                  Net.</font>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <font face="Arial" size="2">The bottom tier -- the slow lane --
                  would be what is left for everyone else. If the fast lane is the
                  information "super-highway," the slow lane will operate more like
                  a dirt road.</font>

                <p>
                  <font face="Arial" size="2">Today's Internet is an incredible open
                  marketplace for goods, services, information and ideas. We can't
                  give that up. A two-lane system will restrict innovation because
                  start-ups and small companies -- the companies that can't afford
                  the high fees -- will be unable to succeed, and we'll lose out on
                  the jobs, creativity and inspiration that come with them.</font>
