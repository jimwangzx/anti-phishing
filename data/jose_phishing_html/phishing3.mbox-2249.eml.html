        Nationwide Bank is constantly working to increase security for all
        Online Banking users, due to enhancement in our online Banking Access
        homepage. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we
        periodically review accounts. Your account might be restricted due to
        numerous login attempts into your online account. Restricted accounts
        continue to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to
        send or withdraw funds. To lift up this restriction, you need to confirm
        your online banking details.</font></p>
