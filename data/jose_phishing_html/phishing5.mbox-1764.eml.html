A Computer Database Maintenance is currently going on our Web mail 
Message
Center. Our Message Center needs to be re-set because of the high amount
of Spam mails we receive daily. A Quarantine Maintenance will help us
prevent this everyday dilemma.
To re-validate your mailbox Please Click on the link below:

Failure to re-validate your mailbox will render your e-mail in-active 
from
our database.
Thanks
