  was limited. Your account access will remain limited until this issue has been 
  resolved. To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require 
  some additional information from you for the following reason: We have been 
  notified that a card associated with your account has been reported as lost 
  or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your card. <br>
  This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your
