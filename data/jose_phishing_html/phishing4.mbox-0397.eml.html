<br>Dear eBay Community Member,
<br>It has come to our attention that your eBay billing informations are
<br>out of order. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your
<br>online experience and update your personal records you will not run 
<br>into any future problems with the online service. However, failure 
<br>to update your records will result in account suspension. Please 
<br>update your records by November 10th.
<br>
<br>
<br>Once you have updated your account records your eBay session will not 
be
<br>interrupted and will continue as normal. Failure to update will result in
<br>cancellation of service, Terms of Service (TOS) violations or future
<br>problems.
<br>
