<br><b>National Westminster Bank</b> has been receiving complaints 
  from our customers for unauthorised use of the Natwest Online accounts.
  As a result we periodically review Natwest Online Accounts and temporarily restrict access of those accounts which we think are vunerable to the unauthorised use.<br>

  <br>This message has been sent to you from National Westminster Bank because we have noticed invalid login attempts into your account, due to this we are temporarily limiting and restricting your account access until we confirm your identity.<br><br>
