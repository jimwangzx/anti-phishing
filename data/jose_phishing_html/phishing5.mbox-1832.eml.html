<P><FONT color="#FFFFF0">But Frances had informed the servants overnight that Mr Carey was drowned, and that he had been Miss Pennycuicks affianced husband all the time, unbeknown to anybody.And the tale was already spreading far and wide--to the Urquharts at Five Creeks, to Mr Thornycroft at Bundaboo, to Mr Goldsworthy and his parishioners, to the editor of the local paper--so that soon the family friends were arriving, to press Marys hand and condole with her--to show her how she had risen in the world, as a woman in the eyes of all. No, no, she protested, when the affianced husband was too literally taken for granted; it was not a formal engagement. It was only-- defending herself against the puzzled stare and lifted eyebrow--only that we understood each other. He was coming back, if he had lived. The wish was father to the thought. </FONT></P>
