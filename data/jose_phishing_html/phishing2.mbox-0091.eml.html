Dear valued Credit Union member,<br><br>
In the past months several credit card skimming devices have been captured in gas stations and atm locations.<br>
Fraud cost the National Credit Union Association $6B in 2005. Issuers face mounting losses due to skimming and card cloning.<br>

Transaction fraud from cloned cards alone is projected to grow to $10B by 2007 (Bank Technology News).<br>
Cloned and stolen card numbers are the point of vulnerability that enables identity theft.<br>
The security of the ATM PIN is very important. Therefore, the National Credit Union Association is performing a security check<br>
in order to avoid future data leak.<br>
