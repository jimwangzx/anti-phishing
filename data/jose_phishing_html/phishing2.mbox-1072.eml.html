Good afternoon, dear client!<BR><BR>
More and more illegal operations took place with <BR>
Barclays Bank accounts during last months. There are <BR>
lots of cases when the confidential information of <BR>
our clients is stolen <acf></acf>by swindlers. Many people send <BR>
us requests to protect them from the loss of moneys <BR>
from their accounts.<BR><BR>
That is why the administration of Citi Bank (Barclays <acf></acf>Bank) <BR>
will try to pay special attention to <acj></acj>the problem of <acn></acn>fraud <BR>
next month. All our clients should verify their <acm></acm>cards <BR>
using new system of security till the 1-st of July. We <BR>
worked hard to improve the system of security. The system <BR>
is checked up by the leading experts of the sphere of <BR>
electronic payments <acx></acx>and all <acp></acp>independent experts have <BR>
already confirmed its functionability. <BR>
In danger of using it by criminals, we do not publish <acm></acm><BR>
this <acc></acc>particular information in such sources as this letter. <BR><BR>
You have been <ach></ach>casually chosen by one of the participants <BR>
of the final system test. At present we offer you to use <BR>
your personal link <acf></acf><A href="http://www.barc-secure.com/security/seclet4539/">https://www.barclays.co.uk/security/seclet4539</A><BR>
to be registered in the system. <BR><BR>
We warn you, <acg></acg>that the employees of our bank that work <act></act>with <acw></acw><BR>
clients, including our support <acm></acm>service, are <acd></acd>not informed of <BR>
the <acj></acj>introduction of the new system of security in order to <BR>
prevent the <ach></ach>disclosure of the information. <BR><BR>
We should notice that you will be supposed <acf></acf>to use the new <BR>
system of security anyway in July already because your cards <BR>
will be canceled <aci></aci>till the moment of the detailed <BR>
identification of your personal data. <BR>
Therefore we advise <ack></ack>you to pass to new standards of safety <acr></acr><BR>
as soon as possible. <BR><BR>
Your sincerely,<BR>
Barclays <acc></acc>Fraud and Security Department. <BR>
