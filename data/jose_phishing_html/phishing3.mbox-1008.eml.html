Dear customer,</font></b><br>
                <br>
                <font face="Arial" size="2">We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in your
				 account from a foreign IP address and we have
reasons to believe
                that your account was used by a third party without
your
                authorization. If you recently accessed your account while 
                traveling, the log
                in attempts may have initiated by you.<br>
                <br>
                However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on 
                the link below and submit, as we try to verify your account.
