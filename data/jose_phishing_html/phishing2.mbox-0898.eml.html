We recently determined that different multiple login attempts have been made on <br>
your PayPal account. One employee of our Customer Service has tried to reach you<br>
by phone. As we did not manage to contact you, this email has been sent to<br>
your notice.<br><br>
Therefore your account has been temporary suspended. We need you to confirm your <br>
identity in order to regain full privileges of your account. If this is not completed<br>
by May 13, 2006, we reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your account<br>
indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes.<br>
<br>
In order to confirm your identity please follow the link below and complete the requested information:<br>
