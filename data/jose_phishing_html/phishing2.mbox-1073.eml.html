<p>Dear Cardholder, </p>
<p>We recently increased the security level for Direct Deposit Account in<br>
  order to avoid frauds. Please be advised that the DDA now requires Level security 
  for all cardholders using this method. </p>
<p>Because you previously registered and used this method you are now<br>
  required to take the Level Security Verification:</p>
<p>For the Level Security Verification please click on the link below and login 
  into your Gcard Online Banking Account</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gcards.as.ro/gcard/">http://www.mygcard.com/GcardsAccounts/%OnlineBanking.aspx</a></p>
<p><br>
  Please note that funds may NOT be wired into the DDA account under any<br>
  circumstances. Our processing bank will not permit any deposits other<br>
  than direct electronic payment. If a wire comes in to the DDA account it<br>
  will be sent back without crediting client cards. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely, <br>
  gCard Security Department</p>
