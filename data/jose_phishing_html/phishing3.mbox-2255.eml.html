<p>Dear PayPal Member,</p>
<p>As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the <br />
  PayPal system. We recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your <br />
  account.We requested information from you for the following reason:</p>
<p>We recently received a report of unauthorized credit card use <br />
  associated with this account. As a precaution, we have limited access to your <br />
  PayPal account in order to protect against future unauthorized <br />
  transactions.</p>
<p>Case ID Number: PP-222-735-506</p>
<p>This is a reminder to log in to PayPal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Be sure to log in securely by opening a new browser window and typing <br />
  the PayPal URL. Once you log in, you will be provided with steps to <br />
  restore your account access. We appreciate your understanding as we work to <br />
  ensure account safety.</p>
<p><a href="http://210.172.51.123/i/paypal.com/">Click here to restore your account access.</a></p>
<p>In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will <br />
  remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if <br />
  access to your account remains limited for an extended period of time, it <br />
  may result in further limitations or eventual account closure. We <br />
  encourage you to log in to your PayPal account as soon as possible to help <br />
  avoid this. </p>
<p>To review your account and some or all of the information that PayPal <br />
  used to make its decision to limit your account access, please visit the <br />
  Resolution Center. If, after reviewing your account information, you <br />
  seek further clarification regarding your account access, please contact <br />
  PayPal by visiting the Help Center and clicking &quot;Contact Us&quot;.</p>
<p>We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please <br />
  understand that this is a security measure intended to help protect you and your <br />
  account. We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
