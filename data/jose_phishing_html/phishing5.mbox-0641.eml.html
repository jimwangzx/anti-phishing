 
	Dear PayPal account holder,

 
	PayPal is constantly working to ensure security by regularly screening the accounts in our system. We have
 recently determined that different computers have tried logging into your PayPal account,and multiple password
 failures were present before the logons. Until we can collect secure information, your access to sensitive account
 features will be limited. We would like to restore your access as soon as possible, and we apologize for the
 inconvenience. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Why is my account access limited?

	Your account access has been limited for the following reason(s):


 March 10, 2008: We have reasons to believe that your account has been accessed by a third party. We have
 limited access to sensitive PayPal account features in case your account has been accessed by an unauthorized
 third party. We understand that having limited access can be an inconvenience, but protecting your account is
 our primary concern. 

(Your case ID for this reason is PP-386-959-031.)
