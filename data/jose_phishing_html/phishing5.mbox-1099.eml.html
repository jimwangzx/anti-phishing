We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third party as different computers have logged into your Online Banking account and multiple password failures where presented before the logons. </DIV>
<DIV>
We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us. We understand that having restricted access can be an inconvenience, but protecting your account is our primary concern.</DIV>

In accordance with our Online Banking User Agreement, your account access will remain restricted until the issue has been resolved. </DIV>
<DIV>
Unfortunately, if access to your account remains restricted for an extended period of time, we will be forced to close your account as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. </DIV>
<DIV>
We encourage you to log in to your Online Banking account as soon as possible to help avoid this.</DIV>
