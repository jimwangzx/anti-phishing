    <td><p align="justify">We  recently reviewed your account, and suspect that your Wells Fargo  Card account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party.  Protecting the security of your account and of the Wells Fargo  network is our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure,  your profile has been locked due to inactivity or because of too many  failed login attempts.<br />
        <br />
        To restore your card account access, please take the following step to ensure that   your account has not been compromised: <br />
        <br />
        Validate your Wells Fargo Account Information for any unauthorized withdrawals, and check you account profile to  make sure not changes have been made.<br />
