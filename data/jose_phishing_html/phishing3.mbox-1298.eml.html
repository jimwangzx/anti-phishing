<p>Dear <strong>Amazon</strong>&reg; member, <br>
</p>
<p>This is your final warning about the safety of your Amazon account. If you do not update your billing informations your 

access on Amazon features will be restricted and the user deleted. This might be due to either following reasons:
<br>
<br>
<br>
- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)
<br>
- Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up process.
<br>
- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within
<br>              
 our processors.
