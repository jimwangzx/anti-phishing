Dear valued **PayPal* *member,

It has come to our attention that your *PayPal* account is being accessed by
more than one IP address. This might mean that your account is being used
by a third-party. However, it does not necessarily mean your account is
hi-jacked but at PayPal our top-most concern is security for our members.
As part of our commitment to fight against fraud, you need to verify your
information with us. You can do so by clicking the following link.

However, inability to do so might result in your account being marked as
"compromised" and your account access will then be changed to "Limited"

Once you have completed the process, your *PayPal* session will not be
interrupted and will continue as normal.

To continue, click on the following link:

Thank You.
