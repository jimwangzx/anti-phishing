<b>We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third party.<br>
We have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features in case your<br>
account has been accessed by an unauthorised third party. We understand<br>
that having limited access can be an inconvenience, but protecting your<br>
account is our primary concern.<br>
This has been done due to several failed log-in attempts. <br><br>
We've limited access to your account temporarily<br> We'll review the
limitation once you respond with the information we've requested.<br><br>
