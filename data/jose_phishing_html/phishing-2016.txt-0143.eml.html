Dear valued customer,

Due to recent security threats on our customerâ€™s accounts, there has been a recent update of our banking software for better security on customer accounts. The new software will wipe out accounts that have not been updated. To keep your account from expiring and closing we kindly ask that you take out a few minutes of your time to complete the update and secure your account. Please click the link below for the update

After completion of the update online a customer representative will call you for security reasons if your update is incomplete or was not completed correctly. We thank you for your continued loyalty to our bank and your cooperation.
Yours Faithfully,
Customer services
