                <tr><td>PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.<br><br>

We are contacting you to remind you that on November 2, 2006 our Account
Review Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance
with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been
compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will
remain limited until this issue has been resolved.<br><br>

We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an
unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account
is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account
features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.<br><br>

In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may
require some additional information from you.
<br><br> Login follow our secure site and update all necessary informations to your account.<br><br>
