<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Customers,<br>
<br>
The Royal Bank of Scotland always look forward for the high security of our 
clients. Some customers have been receiving an email claiming to be from The 
Royal Bank of Scotland advising them to follow a link to what appear to be a The 
Royal Bank of Scotland web site, where 
they are prompted to enter their personal Online Banking details. The Royal Bank 
of Scotland Digital 
Banking is in no way involved with this email and the web site does not belong 
to us.<br>
<br>
The Royal Bank of Scotland is proud to announce about our new updated secure system. We updated our 
new SSL servers to give our customers a better, fast and secure online banking 
service.<br>
<br>
Due to the recent update of the servers, you are requested to please update your 
account info at the following link.<br>
