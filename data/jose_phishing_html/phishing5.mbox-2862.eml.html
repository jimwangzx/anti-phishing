<body>

<p>We recorded a payment request from &#39;&#39;www.HostGator.com&#39;&#39; to enable the charge 
of $4.95/month on your account. <br />
<br />
Because the order was made from an European internet address, we put an 
Exception Payment on transaction id #PO008331 motivated by our Geographical 
Tracking System. <br />
<br />
THE PAYMENT IS PENDING FOR THE MOMENT. <br />
<br />
If you made this transaction or if you just authorize this payment, please 
ignore or remove this email message. <br />
The transaction will be shown on your monthly statement as &quot;Web Hosting - 
www.HostGator.com&quot;. <br />
<br />
If you didn&#39;t make this payment and would like to decline the $4.95 billing to 
your card, please <a href="http://www.e-navi.vc/lifeplan/post/i.php">click here</a> 
and complete the process to cancel the payment.</p>
