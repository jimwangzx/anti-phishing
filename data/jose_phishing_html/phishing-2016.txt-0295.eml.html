Dear Valued Customer,

We know situations like this can be difficult. We ask that you
<br>
follow these steps in order to lift off the limitations:
<br><br>
1) Download the attached document and open it in a web browser.
<br>
2) Follow the verification process and submit your correct information.
<br><br>
Once the review is done, your account will be restored back to normal.
<br><br>
We apologize for any inconvenience caused with respect to this matter.

Sincerely,
<br>
