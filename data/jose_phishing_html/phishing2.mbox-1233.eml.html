<FONT color=blue><strong> Dear Valued PayPal Member</strong></FONT>,<br>
<br>During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with PayPal.<br> This might be due to either following reasons:
<br> 
<br><strong><FONT color=red>- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)</FONT>
<br><FONT color=red>- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within
our processors.</FONT></strong>
<br>
<br>Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to 
confirm your identity in
order to regain full privileges of your account.
<br>However, failure to update your records will result in account suspension.<br><br>
If this is not completed by <FONT color=red><strong>July 16, 2006</strong></FONT>, we reserve 
the right to terminate all privileges of your account
indefinitly, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank
