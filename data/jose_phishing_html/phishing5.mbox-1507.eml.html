Dear Webmail User,

This message was sent automatically by a program on Webmail which periodically checks the size of in boxes, where new messages are received. The program is run weekly to ensure no one's inbox grows too large. If your inbox becomes too large, you will be unable to receive new email. Just before this message was sent, you had 18Megabytes (MB) or more of messages stored in your inbox on your Web mail.To help us re-set your SPACE on our database prior to maintain your INBOX, you must reply to this
e-mail and enter your:
 
Name: 
Webmail Access Page:
User name: 
Password:
Retype Password: 
Date of Birth :

You will continue to receive this warning message periodically if your inbox size continues to be between 18 and 20 MB. If your inbox size grows to 20MB,then a program on the Web mail will move your oldest email to a folder in your home directory to ensure that you will continue to be able to receive incoming email. You will be notified by email that this has taken place. If your inbox grows to 25MB, you will be unable to receive new email as it will be returned to the sender. After you read a message, it is
best to REPLY and SAVE a copy.
 
Thanks,
Web mail Help Desk.
