			Dear PayPal User,<br>
			<br>
			We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your PayPal
			<br>
			account from a foreign IP address.<br>
			<br>
			If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual 
			log <br>
			in attempts may have been initiated by you. However, if you did not
			<br>
			initiate the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to 
			update <br>
			your account:<br>

			Changing your password is a security measure that will ensure that 
			you <br>
			are the only person with access to the account.<br>
			<br>
			Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your 
			account.<br>

			Sincerely,<br>
			PayPal <br>
