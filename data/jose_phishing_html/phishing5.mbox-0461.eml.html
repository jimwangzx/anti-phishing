Dear Amazon Member:<br>
<br>
<br>

Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, Amazon is introducing a new account verification method. From time to time, randomly selected accounts are subjected to an advanced verification process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations and customer debit card.
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this message your account is not confirmed, we reserve the right to suspend you Amazon registration.
Amazon is committed to assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to 
misappropriate 
personal information with the intent to commit fraud or theft.
