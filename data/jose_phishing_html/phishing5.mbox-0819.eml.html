	<p><b>Dear PayPal 
    account holder,</b>10:23 AM 7/9/2008</p>

Due to recent attacks on multiple PayPal accounts and cardholders,<br>
PayPal Online Department has created and implemented a new<br>
security system designed to protect your account and provide<br>
an increased level of protection to your money and personal data.<br> 
After multiple invalid login attempts on your account, we have<br>
strong reasons to believe that it might have been accessed by an<br>
unauthorized third party. This may be due to changes in your IP<br>
address or location. Protecting the security of your account and<br>
the PayPal network is our primary concern.<br>

<B><br>Therefore, PayPal Online Department has limited your access to <br>
sensitive account features until your personal and financial information<br>
are confirmed.</b><br><br>
Once you have completed the steps required to remove the limitation,<br>
please allow us 24 hours to review the information submitted.<br>
    
    <b>In order to remove the limitation on your account, please follow the link below<br>
to one of our secure servers: </b><br><br><br>
