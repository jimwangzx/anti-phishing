Notification of Limited Account Access


As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in
the PayPal system. We recently noticed the following issue on your account:


Unusual account activity has made it necessary to limit sensitive
account features until additional verification information can be collected.

We have been notified that a card associated with your account
has been reported as lost or stolen, or that there were
additional problems with your card.


Case ID Number: PP-071-362-996


Please fill in all the details that are required to complete this verification process.


To do this we have attached a form to this email. Please download the form and follow the
instructions on your screen. NOTE: The form needs to be opened in a modern browser which has
javascript enabled (ex: Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 3, Safari 3, Opera 9)


Please understand that this is a security measure intended to help protect you and your account.
We apologize for any inconvenience.


If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but 
to temporary suspend your account.


Sincerely,
PayPal Account Review Department.
