<p>Dear Google AdWords Customer,</p>
<p>During our regular database verification process, we were<br />
  unable to verify your account information. This might be<br />
  due to one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)</p>
<p>2. Submitting invalid information during initial enrollment process.</p>
<p>3. Inability to accurately verify you account information due to an<br />
  internal error within or database management system.<br />
</p>
<p>We would require login in to your Google AdWords so that we can verify<br />
  that you are the rightful owner of the account. All you nedd to do is<br />
  go to Google AdWords and enter your username and password:</p>
