<font color="white">Even a little one.Toward Magician Humfrey's castle.The lord hauled on Chester's muscular arm.So did Chester.The centaur took off.Her torso had collapsed across her dulcimer.Crombie had balked at the tangle tree.He had broken too many hearts already!The Demon's welfare is also at stake.The lord hauled on Chester's muscular arm.Chester took it down and studied it.</font>
