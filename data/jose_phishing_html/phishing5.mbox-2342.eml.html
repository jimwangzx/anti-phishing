<p>Dear Bank of Ireland Customer,<p>
    As part of our security measures, we regularly review and screen activity in<br>
the Online Banking system. We recently noticed the following issue on your account:<br><br><SPAN class=yshortcuts id=lw_1250974632_0 
style="BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: pointer; moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial"><SPAN 
class=yshortcuts id=lw_1255678357_0 
style="BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: pointer; moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial">Unusual account activity has made it necessary to limit sensitive
account features until<br> additional verification information can be collected</SPAN></SPAN>!.

<p>We have recently developed a new way that secures your banking details,<br> therefore we have attached a form to this email to complete the process.<br>

Please download the form and fill in all the details required to complete <br>this verification process whilst following the instructions on your computer screen.<br><p>Online Security Dept.<p>
