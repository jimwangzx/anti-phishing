Our robust proprietary risk models help to protect you by monitoring for unusual 
activity - and working to stop it.<br>
PayPal's technology evaluates transactions according to hundreds of variables in 
order to pinpoint potentially fraudulent activity. <br>
Our unique, patent-pending methods for bank account verification provide PayPal 
members an additional level of security, which lowers risk and increases trust 
for the entire PayPal community.<br>
<br>
We use powerful encryption methods to help protect your sensitive information.
