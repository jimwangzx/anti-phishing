    <p>Dear Paypal customer,</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in your 
    Paypal&nbsp; online account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to 
    believe that your account was hijacked by a third party without your 
    authorization.</p>
    <p align="justify">If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in 
    attempts may have initiated by you.<br>
    <br>
    However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on the link 
    below and submit, as we try to verify your account:<br>

    <p align="justify">The log in attempt was made from:</p>
    <p align="justify">IP address: <font color="#000000"><b>218.140.50.77</b></font><br>
    ISP host: <font color="#000000"><b>zgrm.com</b></font><br>

    If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to 
    temporally suspend your account.</p>

    we strongly recommend not making any changes to your account in that time.</p>

    action may also be in violation of local, national, and/or international
