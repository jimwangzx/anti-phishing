        Dear valued <b>Bank of Americaï¿½</b> member, <br>
        <br>
        Due to a recent high number of fraudulent transactions, we have
issued 
        the following security requirements. <br>
        <br>
        It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent
transactions are 
        caused by fraudsters using stolen account information to purchase
or sell 
        non existant items. Thus we require our members to enroll in our
SiteKey 
        security upgrade, as part of our continuing commitment to protect
your 
        account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. After
you 
        submit the requested information, we will create a unique algorithm
based 
        on your personal computer, allowing us to recognize you in any
future 
        online banking sessions and thus immediately spotting any
unauthorized 
        access. By passing back and forth secret information that only you
and 
        <b>Bank Of America</b> know, you can feel even more secure with
your online 
        banking experience. We recognize you and you recognize us. If you
could 
        please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and enroll
in the 
        SiteKey security upgrade, you will not run into any future problems
with 
        the <b>Bank Of Americaï¿½</b> online banking service. However,
failure to 
        meet our security requirements will result in your account
suspension. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We are requesting this information to verify and protect your
identity. 
        Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain,
verify, 
        and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or
obtaining 
        ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of
the U.S. 
        banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these
reasons, 
        <b>Bank Of Americaï¿½</b> will utilize services provided by various
credit 
        reporting agencies to verify the information you submit to us. <br>
        <br>
        Once you have enrolled in our SiteKey security upgrade your pending
<b>Bank 
        Of America</b> account transactions will not be interrupted and
will continue 
        as normal. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Please enroll in our SiteKey security upgrade by</b> <a
