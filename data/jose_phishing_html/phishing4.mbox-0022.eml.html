some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud<BR>
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.<BR><BR>

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your<BR>
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your<BR>
account has not been compromised, access to your account was flagged. Your<BR>
account will remain flagged until this issue has been resolved. <BR>
This is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not<BR>
compromised.<BR><BR>

 In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may<BR>

Our system requires further account verification. <BR><BR>
 
Case ID Number: PP-056-245-481<BR>

Should your account remain flagged for an extended period of time, <BR>
it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or<BR>
may result in eventual account closure.<BR><BR>
