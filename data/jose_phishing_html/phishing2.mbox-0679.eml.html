  <BR>
We recently have determined that different computers have logged onto your 
Online Banking account, and multiple
password failures
were present before the logons. We now need you to re-confirm your account 
information to us. If this is not completed
by <strong>March 26, 2006</strong>, we will be forced to suspend your 
account indefinitely, as it may have been
used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this 
manner.</FONT>
