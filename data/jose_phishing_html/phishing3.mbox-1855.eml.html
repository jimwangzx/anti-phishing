    its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our
    anti-fraud teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are contacting you to remind you that our Account Review
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with
    PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been
    compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will
    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.<br>
    <br>
    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some
    additional information from you for the following reason:<br>
    <br>
    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your
    card.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension. <br>
    <br>

    We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on
    the use of your account and possible account closure.<br>
    <br>

    Security Center. We apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we
    apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the
    entire PayPal system.<br>
