Dear Lloyds TSB Online Customer,

As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in 
the Lloyds Online Banking system. We recently noticed the following issue on your account:


Unusual account activity has made it necessary to limit sensitive 
account features until additional verification information can be collected.


Please fill in all the details that are required to complete this verification process.


To do this we developed a new secure way that keeps your banking safe, 
we have attached a form to this email to complete this process. 
Please download the form and follow the instructions on your screen.


If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporary suspend your account.


Sincerely,
The Lloyds TSB Security Department Team.
