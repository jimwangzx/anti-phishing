                <font face="Arial" size="2">

During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with Wells Fargo.<br> This might be due to either following reasons:
<br> 
<br><strong><FONT color=red>- A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address)</FONT>
<br><FONT color=red>- An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within
our processors.</FONT></strong>
<br>
 <br>We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in your
				Wells Fargo account from a foreign IP address and we have
reasons to believe
                that your account was hijacked by a third party without
your
                authorization. If you recently accessed your account while 
                traveling, the log
                in attempts may have initiated by you.<br>
                <br>
                However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on 
                the link below and submit, as we try to verify your account.
