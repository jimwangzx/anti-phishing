Dear Chase member,<br>
<br>
We have reasons to believe that your personal information might be misused or


 your accounts tampered with.<br>
 We strongly advise to take action immediately!<br>

Even if you we do not find any evidence of suspicious activity on your account, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you check your credit reports periodically. Victim information sometimes is held for use or shared among a group of thieves at different times. Checking your credit reports periodically can help you spot problems and address them quickly.<br>
Thank you for your attention,
