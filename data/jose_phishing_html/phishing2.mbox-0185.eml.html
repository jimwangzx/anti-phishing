<b>1.</b> A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address).<br>
<b>2.</b> Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up process.<br>
<b>3.</b> An inability to accurately verify your account information due to an internal error within our processors.<br><br>

Please update and verify your account information with PayPal at:<br><br>
