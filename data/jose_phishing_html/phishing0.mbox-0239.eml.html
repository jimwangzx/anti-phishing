This is a second reminder to log in to PayPal as soon as possible. Once you<br>
log in, you will be provided with steps to restore your account access. <br>
<br>
In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will remain<br>
limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if access to your<br>
account remains limited for an extended period of time, it may result in<br>
further limitations or eventual account closure. We encourage you to log in<br>
to your PayPal account as soon as possible to help avoid this. <br>
<br>

further clarification regarding your account access.<br>

We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please understand<br>
that this is a security measure intended to help protect you and your<br>
account. We apologize for any inconvenience. </P>
