To our Valued Customer,

An intrusion from an un-authorized user have triggered our Secure Login Feature (Auto-geolocation analysis shows that it wasn't you). Currently, your account is limited.

To have full access to your account again (thus removing any limitations), please read the step(s) below:

There are a variety of reasons why an account is set to Limited; One of them is un-authorized access (another user tried to use your account without your consent).

We have sent you a form through which you may download (see attachment). We kindly ask that you provide some information in regards to your account.

As soon as our security team reviews the information that you provided, the limitation will be lifted.

Please do understand that this is a security measure intended to protect you and your account. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Best Regards,
