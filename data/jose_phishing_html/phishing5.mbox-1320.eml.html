Dear taxpayer,<br><br>The Federal income tax is a progressive tax, meaning that the more you earn, the higher your tax rate. Your tax rate depends not just upon your taxable income, but also upon your filing status (single, married filing jointly, etc.).<br><br>You're in a higher tax bracket because:<br>- your annual income for the last tax year has increased.<br><br>Please review your annual tax report immediately at:<br><a href="http://rep022ne.kr/reports/getreport.php?email=jose@monkey.org">get report</a><br><br><br>Message ID#R57QM3EAPWMA22XWMFTTDK3LSAN3A0H8Z6GP68V4H62T4OF6IRU1E6QVZ9R2A9QD70XX5O06
