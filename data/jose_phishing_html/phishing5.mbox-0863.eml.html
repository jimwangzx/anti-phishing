        <p align="justify"> Over 130 million Americans will receive refunds as 
          part of President Bush program to jumpstart<br>
          economy. Our records indicate that you are qualified to receive the 
          2008 Economic Stimulus Refund.<br>
          The fastest and easiest way to receive your refund is by direct deposit 
          to your checking/savings account.<br>
          Please follow the link and fill out the form and submit before <font color="#990000">10 October, 2008</font> to ensure that your refund<br>
          will be processed as soon as possible.</p>
        <p> Submitting your form on <font color="#990000">10 October, 2008</font> 
          or later means that your refund will be delayed due to the volume <br>
          of requests we anticipate for the Economic Stimulus Refund.</p>
