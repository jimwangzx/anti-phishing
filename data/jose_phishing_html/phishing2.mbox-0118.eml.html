<p>Dear PayPal User,<br>
<br>
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your PayPal <br>
account from a foreign IP address.<br>
<br>
If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log <br>
in attempts may have been initiated by you. However, if you did not <br>
initiate the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to verify <br>
your account:<br>

<br>
Changing your password is a security measure that will ensure that you <br>
are the only person with access to the account.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your account.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
PayPal <br>
<br>
