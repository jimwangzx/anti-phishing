Dear valued <b>PayPal�</b> Customer,
<br><br>
Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security requirements.
<br>
<br>
It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caused by members
using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we require our members to add a Debit/Check card
to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of 
fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check card will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5-10 minutes 
out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future problems with the <b>PayPal�</b> 
service. However, failure to confirm your records will result in your account suspension.
<br><br>
We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Federal regulations require all financial 
institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing 
payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S. banking system in terrorist and other illegal 
activity. For these reasons, <b>PayPal�</b> will utilize services provided by various credit reporting agencies to 
verify the information you submit to us.
<br>
<br>
Once you have updated your account records your pending <b>PayPal�</b> account transactions will not be interrupted and 
will continue as normal.
<br><br>
<b>To update your billing records please proceed to our secure webform by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank"

<br>
<br>Thank you for your time,<br>
<b>
PayPal� Billing Department.</b></font>
