  you or somebody else have made several login attempts and reached <br>
  your daily attempt limit. As an additional security measure your <br>
  access to PayPal will be limited in the next 24 hours if you do not <br>
  verify your identity.</p>

<p>Please verify your details clicking on the link above, before trying to <br>
  log in again. You will be able to attempt logging into PayPal account <br>
  immediately after you verify your identity without any limitations <br>
  applying to your account.</p>
