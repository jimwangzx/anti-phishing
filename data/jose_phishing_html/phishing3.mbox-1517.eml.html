If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in

the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to verify your

Verify your identity is a security measure that will ensure that you are
the only person with access to the account.

Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your account.

Sincerely,
PayPal
