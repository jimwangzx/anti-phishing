Dear HSBC Online Customer,

As part of our security measures on our new website, we regularly screen activity on
HSBC and update our online banking system. We recently noticed the following issue on your account:

Unusual account activity has made it necessary to limit sensitive
account features until additional verification data can be made.

Please fill in all the details that are required to complete this verification process.

To do this we developed a new secure way that keeps your banking safe,
we have attached a form to this email to complete this process.

Please download the form and follow the instructions on your screen,once this is done
your account will be updated and back to normal.

If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporary suspend your account.


Sincerely,
HSBC Bank Plc ,
Security Department Team,
2011.
