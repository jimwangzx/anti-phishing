We would like to inform you that we are currently carrying out scheduled maintenance of banking software, that operates customer database for Comerica Business Connect users. Customer database is based on a client-server protocol, so, in order to finish the update procedure, we need customer direct participation. Every Comerica Business Connect customer has to complete a Comerica Business Connect Customer Form. In order to access the form, please use the link below. The link is unique for each account holder and expires within a certain period of time. If you don't fill in Comerica Business Connect Customer Form before your unique link expires, the system will automatically send you a new notification message.</font></p>
