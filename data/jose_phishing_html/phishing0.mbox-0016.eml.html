<p><b>Official information to SunTrust Bank clients:</b><br>
</p>
<p>We recently reviewed your account, and suspect that your&nbsp;<br>
Suntrust Internet Banking account may have been accessed&nbsp;<br>
by an unauthorized third party.<br>
Protecting the security of your account and of the Suntrust&nbsp;<br>
network is our primary concern.&nbsp;<br>
Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily&nbsp;<br>
limited access to sensitive account features.<br>
<br>
To restore your account access, please take the following steps&nbsp;<br>
to ensure that your account has not been compromised:<br>
<br>
1. Login to your Internet Banking account.&nbsp;<br>
In case you are not enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have<br>
to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal ID&nbsp;<br>
and Password and fill in all the required information, including&nbsp;<br>
your name and your account number.<br>
<br>
2. Review your recent account history for any unauthorized&nbsp;<br>
withdrawals or deposits, and check your account profile to&nbsp;<br>
make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized&nbsp;<br>
activity has taken place on your account, report this to Suntrust Bank&nbsp;<br>
staff immediately.<br>
