					Your bank has contacted us regarding some attempts of charges from your credit card via the 
                    Amazon 
system. We have reasons to believe that you changed your registration information or that someone 
else has unauthorized access to your Amazon account
                    Due to recent activity, including possible unauthorized listings 
                    placed on your account, we will require a second confirmation 
                    of your identity with us in order to allow us to investigate 
                    this matter further. Your account is not suspended, but if 
                    in 48 hours after you receive this message your account is 
                    not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your Amazon 
                    registration. If you received this notice and you are not 
                    the authorized account holder, please be aware that it is in 
                    violation of Amazon policy to represent oneself as another 
                    Amazon user. Such action may also be in violation of local, 
                    national, and/or international law. Amazon is committed to 
                    assist law enforcement with any inquires related to attempts 
                    to misappropriate personal information with the intent to 
                    commit fraud or theft. Information will be provided at the 
                    request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that 
                    perpetrators are prosecuted to the full 
                    extent of the law.</font><BR>
