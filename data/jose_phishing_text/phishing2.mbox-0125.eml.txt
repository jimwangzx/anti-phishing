So, I'm carrying an "icon" where it says "I am a member since less than 30 days". A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a positive feedback. But still, mine's got a "zero" feedback? Why is it that? If I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback. But the feedback counting doesn't go from zero to one. Is it because I'm a member who's been registered for less than 30 days?. Regards, Gretta. Respond to this question in My Messages.
