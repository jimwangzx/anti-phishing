 Dear Wells Fargo valued customer, During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with Wells Fargo. This might be due to either following reasons: - A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address) - An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within our processors. We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in your Wells Fargo account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was hijacked by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the log in attempts may have initiated by you. However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on the link below and submit, as we try to verify your account. https://www.wellsfargo.com/ (http://75.179.17.139/icons/secure/secure/online/ssl_encrypt/login/index.php) The log in attempt was made from: IP address: 211.72.153.170 ISP host: 211.72.153.170-mail.tw If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporally suspend your account. We ask that you allow at least 72hrs for the case to be investigated and we strongly recommend not making any changes to your account in that time. * Please do not respond to this email as your reply will not be received.
