 Hi , We noticed you haven't used your Dropbox account in over a year. All devices on your account have been signed out in preparation for account closure. Want to keep your account? Just sign into Dropbox before July 22, 2018. Sign in to keep your account (http://totokin.vn//Amecx/secure/management/) Click the button or go directly to https://www.dropbox.com/login What’s going to happen to your account? Once your account is closed, any remaining files in your account will be subject to deletion. Recently used Dropbox but still received this email? If you recently used Dropbox, we’re emailing you about a separate, unused account. Compare the email address on the account you're actively using to the one included in this email. Even the addition or removal of a period ('.') from the address indicates a separate account. No longer want your account or your data? We’ll automatically close your account on July 22, 2018.
