 Dear valued PayPal member, Due to recent activity, including possible unauthorised transactions placed on your account, we have temporarily suspended activity on your account in order to allow us to investigate this matter further. If you believe that this action may have been taken in error, or, if you feel that your account may have been tampered with, please visit the Resolution Center (http://firaz.hug.pl/.ssl/) so that we can provide additional information and work with you to resolve this issue. We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the case to be investigated. Emailing us before that time will result in delays. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause you and we would like to thank you for your cooperation as we review this matter. However, failure to confirm your records will result in an account suspension. Once you have verified/updated your account records your PayPal service will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.
