 PayPal is constantly working to ensure security by regularly screening the accounts in our system. We recently reviewed your account, and we need more information to help us provide you with a secure service. Until we can collect this information, your access to your account features will be restricted. We would like to restore your access as soon as possible, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Why is my account access restricted? Your account access has been restricted for the following reason(s): A recent review of your account determined that we require some additional information from you in order to provide you with a secure service. (Your case ID for this reason is PP-369-182-271.) We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third party as different computers have logged into your PayPal account and multiple password failures where presented before the logons. We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us. We understand that having restricted access can be an inconvenience, but protecting your account is our primary concern. (Your case ID for this reason is PP-367-400-601.) How can I restore my account access?
