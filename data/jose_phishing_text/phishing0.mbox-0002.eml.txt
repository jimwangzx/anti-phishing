A cutting edge technology patented by the University of Alabama at Huntsville , that can detect radioactive “dirty bombs”, chemical and biological threats.

That's good news…but it gets better! At the same time Mr. Hall cancelled his stock, the company approved a 5 for 1 forward stock split. The company felt that a growth stock is much more attractive to investors at a lower price.
