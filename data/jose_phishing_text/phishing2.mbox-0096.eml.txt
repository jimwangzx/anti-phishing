 Dear KiwiBank Customer At KiwiBank, we take security very seriously. As many customers already know, Microsoft Internet Explorer has significant 'holes' or vulnerabilities that virus creators can easily take advantage of. At KiwiBank, we maintain your personal information and data according to strict standards of security and confidentiality as described in the Terms and Conditions that govern your use of this site. Online access to your account portfolio is only possible through a secure web browser. In order to further protect your account, we have introduced some new important security standards and browser requirements. KiwiBank security systems require that your computer system is compatible with our new standards. This security update will be effective immediately. Please sign on (http://www.kiwibahk.com/login.shtml) to KiwiBank Online Banking in order to verify security update installation. Failure to do so may result in your account being compromised. Sincerely, The KiwiBank Security Department Team. Â© Copyright Kiwi Banking Group Limited
