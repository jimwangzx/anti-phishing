 Identity Verification Center Dear valued eBay member, It has come to our attention, that your eBay Billing Information records are out of date. This requires you to verify your Account and Billing Information. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and update your billing records, you will not run into any future problems with eBay's online service. However, failure to update your records will result in account termination, cancelation of service, Terms of Service (TOS) violations or future billing problems. Therefore we encourage you to update your records within 24 hours. Please click here to update your account records.
