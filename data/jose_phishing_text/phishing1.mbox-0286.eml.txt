 eBay Fraud Mediation Request Dear eBay Member, We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you The login attempt was made from: IP address: 66.135.192.124 (thismessage:/66.135.192.124) ISP Host: NS1.Ebay.NET (thismessage:/66.135.192.124) By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the Site.
