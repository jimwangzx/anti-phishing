 � � � Dear Customer, � Halifax is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically review accounts. Your account might be place on restricted status due to numerous login attempts into your account. Restricted accounts continue to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds. All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from your account, until you have updated your billing information on file. To initiate the update confirmation process. You are now required to follow the link below and fill in the necessary fields. Please click on Sign in to Online Banking (http://neilslade.com/forum/tp-images/File/Login.php) to continue to the verification process and ensure your account security. It is all about your security. Important Notice: You are strictly advised to match your Security Question and Answers rightly to avoid service suspension. Thank you for your co-operation.
