On my personal network, I don't care if they re-connect or blow up. - -------------------------- I try and implement aggressive filters (bogon/flood-blocking/nbar/URPF/anti-spoof, etc.) for my customer networks. Yes it works for the most part but we occasionally run into buffer/congestion issues and this is where qos comes to our rescue. We monitor (proactive approach) our qos policies very closely because they can possibly work against us given certain (white-list) application-level data rate that are in use. regards, /virendra > > > > =+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+ > J.
