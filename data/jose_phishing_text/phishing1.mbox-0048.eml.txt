Until we can collect this information, your access to sensitive account features will be limited. We would like to restore your access as soon as possible, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Why is my account access limited? Your account access has been limited for the following reason(s): We recently have determined that different computers have logged into your PayPal account, and multiple password failures. We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an unauthorised third party.

We reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your account on June 23, 2005.
