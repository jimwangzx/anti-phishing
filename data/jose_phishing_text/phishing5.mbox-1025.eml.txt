 Hi, I am responding to the email for your auction which was posted on eBay. I believe i emailed you a week ago regarding this sale, and my interest in it. Please confirm that it is the same auction with the one posted on eBay link: http://signin.ebay.com/viewitem/ (http://clientes19.dnspropio.com/roundcube/logs/ws/eBayISAPIdll/SignInruhttp3A/www.ebay.com/trksidm37/ndex.htm) I am very interested in this auction and ready to complete the deal as soon as possible. Hope to hear from you soon! Sincerely, Steve Neff
