 Lift your PayPal restriction Trouble reading this? View online (http://paypal.co.uk.crabdance.com/.index.html) Dear Paypal User, You may have noticed that some limitations have been placed on your PayPal account. As a valued PayPal customer, we want to let you know what this means and how to resolve the situation. What does it mean to have limited access? Your account may be restricted for a number of reasons; you'll find out when you next log in to PayPal. As a result, you'll notice that some of the following options are now unavailable: � Send money to other PayPal users � Request or receive money from other users � Edit or remove account details � Close your PayPal account How do I resolve the issue? To assist us in our review, please log in to your account here (http://64.169.30.26/.index.html). You will see a message explaining why your account has been restricted, with details of what to do next. The account limitation process helps to maintain PayPal as a safer way to buy and sell. It's similar to passing through a security checkpoint. When we limit an account we often simply ask the user to supply information to verify their identity, financial information or the merchandise they're selling. PayPal aims to review account information within 48 hours* so please aim to get the information to us as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, PayPal *Reviews are performed in the order they are received. How do I know this is not a Spoof email? Spoof or �phishing� emails tend to have generic greetings such as "Dear PayPal member". Emails from PayPal will always address you by your first and last name.
