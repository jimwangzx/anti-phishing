 Dear Regions Bank customer, In order to be prepared for the smart card upgrade on Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards and to avoid problems with our ATM services, we have recently introduced additional security measures and upgraded our software. The security upgrade will be effective immediately and requires our customers to update their ATM card information. Please update your information by following the link given below. http://www.regions.com/ (http://209.197.151.46/~josh/www.regions.com/) пїЅпїЅRegions Bank Online Banking
