 Phishing is the attempt to obtain personal information online and is one of the most common forms of internet fraud. If you have an email account, you've probably been on the receiving end of a phishing email at one stage or another. These emails are usually very believable and if you do give personal information to phishers, they can use it for financial gain or identity theft. We have launched a new and improved "Email Protector" service and have ensured a smooth transition to the improved platform without impacting you.
