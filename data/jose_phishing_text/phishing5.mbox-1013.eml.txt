 Dear Visa Cardholder, Continuous Monitoring is an integral part of Visa's multiple layers of security. In addition to other fraud monitoring tools, we can often spot fraud based upon transactions on the card that are outside of cardholders typical purchasing pattern. This allows us to spot fraudulent activity as quickly as possible and acts as an early-warning system to identify fraudulent activity. During a recent checkout we detected suspicious activity and your Visa card may have been compromised. Fraudulent activity made it necessary to limit your card for online services. Your Case ID Number is: DD7Q8QQ9EDR7 Conform to our security requirements and in order to continue online services with your card, we must validate your identity.

As part of our commitment to fighting fraud we have the right to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of the terms and conditions for using Visa. Sincerely, Visa Customer Service. Â© Copyright 2001-2009, Visa All Rights Reserved.
