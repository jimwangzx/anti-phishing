 Place or Update Credit Card on File Dear eBay member, During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with eBay. Your card will be used for identification only and will not be charged at any time. By having this type of identification from all users, eBay remains a safe place to buy and sell. Setting up a seller account necessitates valid credit or debit card and checking account information. For automatic payments, your credit card will normally be charged 5 to 7 days after you receive your invoice. Enter and submit the required information. Your account may be suspended for non-payment, and you may be responsible for collection costs.
