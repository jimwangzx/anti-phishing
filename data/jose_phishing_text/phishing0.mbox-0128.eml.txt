These fraudulent emails may address you with the salutation "Dear PayPal User" or "Dear PayPal Member." These emails are not from PayPal. PayPal will only address you by your first and last name, or the business name associated with the account. Use the following tips to protect your PayPal account: First name, last name, business name Email and password combination Credit card, bank account, and PIN number Social security and driver's license number Do not download attachments, software updates, or any application to your computer via a link you received in an email. PayPal will not ask you to download anything for your account to work. Choose a unique password and change it every 30-60 days.
