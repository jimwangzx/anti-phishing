 Dear Customer, The online account with us will be suspended. (reason: terms of service violation). Although the account is still active, the data may be available for up to 24 hours, after which it will be deleted. If you feel this suspension is an error, please click here as soon as possible (http://beaconsfieldairporttaxis.co.uk/wp-admin/includes/wx.htm). *Warning* Do not login elsewhere after you verify the account within 24 hours, to avoid duplicate access records in our database as this could cause the account being suspended again. Thank you, USAA.
