 ﻿﻿ Your credit/debit card information must be updated Dear eBay Member, We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your account while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by you. The login attempt was made from: IP address: 172.25.210.66 ISP Host: cache-66.proxy.aol.com By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our users provide us when they register on the Site. However, because user verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does not confirm each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline verification system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing with. click on the link below, fill the form and then submit as we will verify http://www.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?VerifyRegistrationShow (http://66.219.101.29/index.php) Please save the above link for your reference Please Note: - If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporally suspend your account. * Please do not respond to this e-mail as your reply will not be received.
