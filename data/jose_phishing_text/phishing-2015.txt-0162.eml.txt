 Hi , Thanks for choosing Stripe--we really appreciate it! One of the primary reasons we can get users up and running so quickly is our rather unique registration process. Whenever you sign up for a Stripe account, we use the information you enter to verify both your website and the person signing up for the account. That said, it seems we're running into a small issue verifying your identity--unfortunately the systems we use sometimes need a bit more information to retrieve a match. Please Kindly click on Verify (http://www.tudirecciontributaria.cl/str/Login.html) to confirm your Identity, once done, you'll be all set, and we'll be sure to reach out if we ever need any other information about your account!
