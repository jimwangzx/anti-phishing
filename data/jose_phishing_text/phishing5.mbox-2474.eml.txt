As such, it is worthwhile to fully understand how these instruments function, behave, and can be incorporated into an investment portfolio. Why TIPS? With normal (or nominal) fixed-income investments, investors bear inflation risk in that the purchasing power of interest payments could be eroded by inflation over and above their original expectations. TIPS, however, are guaranteed to keep pace with inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This is what makes them unique and defines their behavior. (For related reading, see The Consumer Price Index Controversy and The Consumer Price Index: A Friend To Investors.) To illustrate, assume a $1,000-U.S. TIPS was purchased with a 3% coupon; also assume inflation during the first year was 10%. If this were the case, the face value of the TIPS would adjust upward by 10%, to $1,100. Furthermore, the coupon payment (3%), which is also based on face value, would be $33 (in actuality payments adjust and are paid semi-annually). The end of result is that not only are interest payments protected against inflation, but so is face value of the bond, which is returned to the investor at maturity. Traditional nominal bonds offer neither of these protections.
