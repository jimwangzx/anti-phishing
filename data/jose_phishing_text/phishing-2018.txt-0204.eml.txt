Attached to this email is your encrypted electronic statement with enhanced security. To open it simply follow the step-by-step instructions below. Also, please advise us if your email address changes – that way we can ensure that you receive your eStatement safely, on time, every time. By opting for eStatements, you’re making a tangible contribution to shrink your, and Nedbank’s, carbon footprint. As South Africa’s green bank, and to show our commitment to a cleaner, greener world, Nedbank will donate 25c to The Green Trust for every eStatement we send. It’s the small things we do together that add up to make a big difference in curbing climate change. Opening your encrypted statement To open your statement you will need Adobe Reader version 5 or higher. Click here to download (http://www.adobe.com). Step 1: Double-click on the attachment. Step 2: Type in your password. Step 3: Click 'OK'. This message has been digitally signed to enable you to verify both its origin and integrity. If the message has been tampered with in any way, a security warning will alert you when you open the mail. To verify the sender’s digital identity simply click on the red ribbon. Your Password Your password is your account number. To help you avoid confusion if you have multiple current accounts, simply look at the name of the attachment in the email – the last four digits are the same as the last four digits in your account number. However, please be sure that you use your full account number when typing in your password(s). Statement Cycle Nedbank will email your statement in accordance with your chosen statement cycle (eg monthly). If we encounter a problem delivering your eStatement – eg mailbox is full – we will continue trying for up to 24 hours. Thereafter the email will be deemed ‘undeliverable’. If your statements remain undelivered for three consecutive cycles, Nedbank will cease to send you eStatements. To resume the service, simply contact Nedbank on 0860 555 111 and ensure that your eStatements delivery details are up to date. For more information or if you need assistance with your eStatement call 0860 555 111 between 07:30 and 18:00 Monday to Friday and 7:30 and 13:00 on Saturdays. eNotes Sign up for Nedbank’s new active SMS update service ... more...
