 Dear customer, Greetings from Amazon Payments. This is a note to let you know that we are having difficulty verifying some of your credit card information. The institution that issued your credit card has not yet authorized its use. There is no reason to believe anything is amiss with your credit card. Errors such as this are usually the result of a small detail in the name, expiration date, or ZIP code information you submitted not matching the records at the credit card institution. We suggest that you contact the institution to verify your account information. Once confirmed, please follow the link below to resubmit your credit card information. We recommend using the "Enter new credit card" option when prompted : click here (http://lamisto.pochta.ru/interfata_amazon.htm) Thank you for selling at Amazon.com. Amazon.com !
