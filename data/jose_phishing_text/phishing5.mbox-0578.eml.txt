 Dear valued Bank of Americaï¿½ member, Due to a recent high number of fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security requirements. It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caused by fraudsters using stolen account information to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we require our members to enroll in our SiteKey security upgrade, as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. After you submit the requested information, we will create a unique algorithm based on your personal computer, allowing us to recognize you in any future online banking sessions and thus immediately spotting any unauthorized access. By passing back and forth secret information that only you and Bank Of America know, you can feel even more secure with your online banking experience. We recognize you and you recognize us. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and enroll in the SiteKey security upgrade, you will not run into any future problems with the Bank Of Americaï¿½ online banking service. However, failure to meet our security requirements will result in your account suspension. We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S. banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons, Bank Of Americaï¿½ will utilize services provided by various credit reporting agencies to verify the information you submit to us. Once you have enrolled in our SiteKey security upgrade your pending Bank Of America account transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.

Thank you for your time, Regards, M.Larry Simmons Bank Of Americaï¿½ Security Department.
