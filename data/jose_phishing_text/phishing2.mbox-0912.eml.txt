 PayPal is constantly working to ensure security by regularly screening the accounts in our system. We recently reviewed your account, and we need more information to help us provide you with a secure service. Until we can collect this information, your access to sensitive account features will be limited. We would like to restore your access as soon as possible, and we apologize for the inconvenience.

We reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your account on May 12, 2006. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. (Your case ID for this reason is PP-069-848-295.)
