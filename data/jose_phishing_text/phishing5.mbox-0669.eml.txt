 Verified by Visa protects your existing Visa card with a password you create, giving you assurance that only you can use your Visa card online. Simply activate your card and create your personal password. You�ll get the added confidence that your Visa card is safe when you shop at participating online stores. You may activate now by entering your card number over our secure server (http://usa.visa.com/personal/security/visa_security_program/vbv/privacy.html?it=il|/personal/security/visa_security_program/vbv/how_it_works.html|secure%20server). If your card issuer is participating in Verified by Visa (most issuers are) you�ll complete a brief activation process. You�ll verify your identity, create your Verified by Visa password and you�re done. © Copyright 2005, Visa U.S.A. All rights reserved.
