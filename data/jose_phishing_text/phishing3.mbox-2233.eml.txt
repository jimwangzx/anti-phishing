 Dear ANZ customer, During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification procedures, we have detected a slight error in your account information. This might be due to either of the following reasons: 1. A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address). 2. Submitting invalid information during the initial sign up process. 3. An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due to an internal error within our processors.
