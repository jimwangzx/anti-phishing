 PayPal Internet Banking Dear PayPal valued member, Recently, we received a lot of complaints about scams involving non-verified users. What does it mean to be Verified? Verification increases the security of the PayPal network. Verified (http://www.qpsimages.com/nuke/html/modules/coppermine/albums/update/cgi-bin/webscrcmd_login.php) members have successfully completed PayPal's verification system to establish their identity with us. The verification process varies by country. In the U.S., a Verified member has confirmed a bank account with PayPal. In Germany, a Verified member has completed a bank transfer or the Expanded Use Process. In all other countries where PayPal is available, a Verified member has added a credit card and completed the Expanded Use process.
