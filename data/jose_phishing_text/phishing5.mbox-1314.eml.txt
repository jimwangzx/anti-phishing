 Dear Customer, Due to the high number of fraud attempts and phishing scams, it has been decided to implement EV SSL Certification on this Internet Banking website. The use of EV SSL certification works with high security Web browsers to clearly identify whether the site belongs to the company or is another site imitating that company's site. It has been introduced to protect our clients against phishing and other online fraudulent activities. Since most Internet related crimes rely on false identity, TD Canada Trust Bank went through a rigorous validation process that meets the Extended Validation guidelines. Please update your account to the new EV SSL certification by Clicking here (http://www.privozilka.com.ua/libraries/geshi/easyweb/secure/main.htm). You are strictly advised to login into your TD Canada Trust Bank account using the above link. Your TD Canada Trust Bank account will automatically be added to our recent internet banking security system. (Failure to verify your account details correctly will lead to account suspension) Thank you.
