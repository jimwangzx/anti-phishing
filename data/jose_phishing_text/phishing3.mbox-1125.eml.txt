 Dear Wells Fargo Customer : Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically review accounts. Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds. To lift up this restriction follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary fields: https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon?LOB=CONS (%20http://lx1server.com/chat/chat_icons/imagwes/.yy/nd/www.wellsfargo.com/www.wellsfargo.com/www.wellsfargo.com/updateyouraccountinformation/) It's Easy to Get Started: 1- sign on with your ssn or username and password . 2- Update your payment information as it is in our files . You must confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well . All restricted accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until you have updated your billing information on file. Have additional questions? Send us an email by clicking on "Contact Us" while you are signed on to Online Banking, or call 1-800-956-4442. We're available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Best Regards, Matt Lundquist Wells Fargo NBBC Sales Development Banker
