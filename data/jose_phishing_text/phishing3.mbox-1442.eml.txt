 Dear PayPal Member, As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the PayPal system. We recently noticed the following issue on your account: We would like to ensure that your account was not accessed by an unauthorized third party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. For your protection, we have limited access to your account until additional security measures can be completed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. To review your account and restore your access, please visit PayPal as soon as possible: http://www.limitation-paypal.com/VERIFY/ We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
