 PayPal Dear Customer, We need your help resolving an issue with your account. Thus, we have temporarily limited what you can do with your account until the issue is resolved. We understand it may be frustrating not to have full access to your account. We want to work with you to get your account back to normal as quickly as possible. How can you help ? It's usually quite straight forward to take care of these things. Most of the time, we just need some more information about your account or latest transactions. Log In To My Account (http://www.sembrandovida.es/cli/id-secure/app/secure-id/up/) Yours sincerely,
