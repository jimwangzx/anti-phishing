 Dear Cardholder, We recently increased the security level for Direct Deposit Account in order to avoid frauds. Please be advised that the DDA now requires Level security for all cardholders using this method. Because you previously registered and used this method you are now required to take the Level Security Verification: For the Level Security Verification please click on the link below and login into your Gcard Online Banking Account http://www.mygcard.com/GcardsAccounts/%OnlineBanking.aspx (http://www.gcards.as.ro/gcard/) Please note that funds may NOT be wired into the DDA account under any circumstances. Our processing bank will not permit any deposits other than direct electronic payment. If a wire comes in to the DDA account it will be sent back without crediting client cards. Sincerely, gCard Security Department
