A : Many reasons are available : 1st , some internet sites offer illegal contents to attract visitors . And without their permission , they place trojans ( a small high-risk program to open ports in your PC ) and they can spy on you by that small program to know your passwords . 2nd , you may accept files from an unknown person that have the same mission . 3rd , you may have accessed your online account via a public PC . ---------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Wells Fargo - Online Banking.
