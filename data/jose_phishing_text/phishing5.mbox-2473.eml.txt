 Dear Valued Customer Barclays Bank has been receiving complaints from our customers for unauthorised use of Barclays accounts. As a result we periodically review Barclays and temporarily restrict access of those accounts which we think are vunerable to the unauthorised use. This message has been sent to you from Barclays Security Department because we have noticed invalid login attempts into your account, due to this we are temporarily limiting and restricting your account access until we confirm your identity. To confirm your identity and remove your account limitation please download the form attached to this email, fill the form and login. Sincerely, Best Regards. Barclays Security Department Team.
