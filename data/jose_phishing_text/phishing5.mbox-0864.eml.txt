 Dear Google AdWords Customer, During our regular database verification process, we were unable to verify your account information. This might be due to one or more of the following reasons: 1. A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address) 2. Submitting invalid information during initial enrollment process. 3. Inability to accurately verify you account information due to an internal error within or database management system. We would require login in to your Google AdWords so that we can verify that you are the rightful owner of the account.
