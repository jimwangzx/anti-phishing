 Dear GTE Federal Credit Union Customer , In an effort to continually measure the service quality given to GTE members we send out random surveys asking for valuable feedback on how we are doing and how we can improve. There are only a few questions to score and should only take a few moments of your time. Your patience will be rewarded with $20 direct deposit to your account and your name will automatically be entered into our quarterly drawing for a $1500 grand prize. Thank you! Sincerely, Board of Directors The GTE Federal Credit Union Take the survey!
