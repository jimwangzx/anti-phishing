Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. To restore your PayPal Account Access click on the link below: www.paypal.com (http://secure-mode.fivepals.com/.online/secure/area/identification-code-account-suspended/) Completing all of the checklist items will automatically restore your account access. Once you log in, you will be provided with steps to restore your account access. We appreciate your understanding as we work to ensure account safety. In accordance with PayPal User Agreement, your account access will remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if access to your account remains limited for an extended period of time, it may result in further limitations or eventual account closure.
