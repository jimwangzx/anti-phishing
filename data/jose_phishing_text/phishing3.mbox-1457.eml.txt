 Ebay is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of customers. To protect the security of your account, Ebay employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud teams regularly screen the Ebay system for unusual activity. We are contacting you to remind you that on 04 February 2007 our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with Ebay's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will remain limited until this issue has been resolved. To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some additional information from you for the following reason: We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your card. This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension.

Allowing your account access to remain limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on the use of your account and possible account closure.

We apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the entire Ebay system. Thank you for using Ebay! The Ebay Team
