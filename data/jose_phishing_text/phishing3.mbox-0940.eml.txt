 Dear ANZ Customer, In an effort to continually measure the service quality given to New zealand and Australia ANZ members we send out random surveys asking for valuable feedback on how we are doing and how we can improve. There are only a few questions to score and only take a few moments of your time. Your patience will be rewarded with $20 direct deposit to your account and your name will automatically be entered into our quarterly drawing for a $2500 grand prize. If you are ready for feedback go to http://anzfeedback.com/inetbank/bankmain.php. If this link does not work just copy and paste it to your browser. Thank you! Sincerely Yours, Board of Directors ANZ Bank. пїЅ Copyright Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522, 1996-2006 Web Site Terms of Use (https://www.anz.com/australia/support/general/disclaimer.asp) | About This Site (https://www.anz.com/australia/support/general/AboutSite.asp) | ANZ Web Site Security and Privacy Statement (https://www.anz.com/australia/support/general/Privacystatement.asp)
