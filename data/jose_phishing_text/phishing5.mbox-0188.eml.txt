 We recently have determined that different computers have logged onto your online Citi Cards account, and multiple password failures were present before the logons. We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us. If this is not completed by September 22, 2007, we will be forced to suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner.
