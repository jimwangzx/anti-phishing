 New Security Feature - Sign-In Protection We recommend that you sign up for Lloyds TSB new Online Banking security feature, which helps protect your account from unauthorized users. How does this new security feature work? Sign-In Protection adds an extra level of verification to the sign-in process -- it's like putting a second lock on your door. Any attempts to access your Online Banking accounts from a computer we don't recognize will be prevented unless the correct answer to one of your personal verification questions is given.
