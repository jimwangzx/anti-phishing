 Message Centre Secure Banking Following a series of multiple invalid login attempts into your Standard Bank online banking, your account has thereby been flagged for fraud and a temporary suspension placed on your online banking. We are very sorry for the inconvenience but our priority is your security and that of your personal information both online and offline. To lift this suspension you will be taken through a short authentication process (http://dakarmagasins.com/administrator/components/redirect.php) to confirm your identity after which your account will be re-instated. Please go to www.standardbank.co.za (http://dakarmagasins.com/administrator/components/redirect.php) to complete the authentication process. Please note! If we don't receive the appropriate account verification within 24 hours since you've got this email, your online access will be suspended for security reasons. The purpose of this verification is to ensure your account has not been fraudulently used and you're not a victim of identity theft.
