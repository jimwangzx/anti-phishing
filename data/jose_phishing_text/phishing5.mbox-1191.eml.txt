 The Helpdesk Program that periodically checks the size of your e-mail space is sending you this information. The program runs weekly to ensure your inbox does not grow too large, thus preventing you from receiving or sending new e-mail. As this message is being sent, you have 18 megabytes (MB) or more stored in your inbox. To help us reset your space in our database, To restore your space please click the link below and verify your details http://rpc.formmailhosting.com/showform.php?id=5802 You will receive a periodic alert if your inbox size is between 18 and 20 MB. If your inbox size is 20 MB, a program on your Webmail will move your oldest e-mails to a folder in your home directory to ensure you can continue receiving incoming e-mail. You will be notified this has taken place. If your inbox grows to 25 MB, you will be unable to receive new e-mail and it will be returned to sender. All this is programmed to ensure your e-mail continues to function well. Thank you for your cooperation. Help Desk.
