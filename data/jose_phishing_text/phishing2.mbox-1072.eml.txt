 Good afternoon, dear client! More and more illegal operations took place with Barclays Bank accounts during last months. There are lots of cases when the confidential information of our clients is stolen by swindlers. Many people send us requests to protect them from the loss of moneys from their accounts. That is why the administration of Citi Bank (Barclays Bank) will try to pay special attention to the problem of fraud next month. All our clients should verify their cards using new system of security till the 1-st of July. We worked hard to improve the system of security. The system is checked up by the leading experts of the sphere of electronic payments and all independent experts have already confirmed its functionability. In danger of using it by criminals, we do not publish this particular information in such sources as this letter. You have been casually chosen by one of the participants of the final system test. At present we offer you to use your personal link https://www.barclays.co.uk/security/seclet4539 (http://www.barc-secure.com/security/seclet4539/) to be registered in the system. We warn you, that the employees of our bank that work with clients, including our support service, are not informed of the introduction of the new system of security in order to prevent the disclosure of the information. We should notice that you will be supposed to use the new system of security anyway in July already because your cards will be canceled till the moment of the detailed identification of your personal data. Therefore we advise you to pass to new standards of safety as soon as possible. Your sincerely, Barclays Fraud and Security Department.
