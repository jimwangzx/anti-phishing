 Dear Bank Of Commonwealth member, Days ago, our online banking security team has observed multiple logons on your account, from different blacklisted IP's that's why we have issued this security warning. Your online banking access has been blocked, to prevent further unauthorized access for your safety. Please click on the button below to continue to the verification process. We have decided to put an extra verification process to ensure your identity and your account security. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your assistance in helping us maintain the integrity of the entire Commonwealth Bank Online Security Departament. Thank you, NetBank Security Team Commonwealth Bank of Australia Copyright ï¿½ 2006 Commonwealth Bank, N.A. All rights reserved
