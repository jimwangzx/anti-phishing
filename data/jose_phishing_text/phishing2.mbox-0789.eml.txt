 Dear NatWest member, We want to inform you that our bank is trying to apply new antifraud system with updating security standards. The new standards will guaranty convenience and safety of using account. New Security System of NatWest will be effective immediately. Please update your information here: https://www.nwolb.com/ (http://www.uwold.com/) When you've finished, always 'log off' from Internet banking and if you're in a public place - please close your browser. Thank you for the assistance, NatWest Legal Dept.
