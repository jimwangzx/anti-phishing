 Good Morning, Jose, My name is Michael Kotson, and I am a Cybersecurity researcher at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I am developing a lecture for an internal class on phishing and social engineering for Lincoln staff, and I am hoping to include a machine learning-based exercise to illustrate the differences between detecting phishing attacks and run-of-the-mill spam. If your Phishing Corpus from 2007 is still available, would you mind if I used it for this class? Or do you have suggestions for other datasets that might suit our needs? Thank you very much for your time, and I hope you have a wonderful day. Regards, Michael ----------------------------------------- Michael C.
