 Plus d'informations Protect Your Password You should never give your PayPal password to anyone, including PayPal employees (https://www.paypal.com/gr/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/Customer/popup/SecurityKeyVIP-outside) Dear PayPal Member, Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security requirements. It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are caused by members using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we require our members to add a Debit/Check card to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check card will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5-10 minutes out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future problems with the PayPal速 service. However, failure to confirm your records will result in your account suspension. We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S. banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons, PayPal速 will utilize services provided by various credit reporting agencies to verify the information you submit to us. Once you have updated your account records your pending PayPal速 account transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. It has come to our attention that your PayPal Information records are out of date. That requires you to update the Information. Failure to update your records will result in account termination. Please update your records within 24 hours. Once you have updated your account records, your PayPal session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.
