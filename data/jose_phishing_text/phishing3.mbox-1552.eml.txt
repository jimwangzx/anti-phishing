 Dear Capital One Customer, Continuous Monitoring is an integral part of Capital One multiple layers of security. In addition to other fraud monitoring tools, we can often spot fraud based upon transactions on the card that are outside of cardholder's typical purchasing pattern. This allows us to spot fraudulent activity as quickly as possible and acts as an early-warning system to identify fraudulent activity. During a recent checkout we detected suspicious activity and your account may have been compromised. Fraudulent activity made it necessary to limit your account for online services.
