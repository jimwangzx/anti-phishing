FOOD
Beyond's Stock Is Red Meat

Beyond Meat, the plant-based meat company (still not used to writing that), reported earnings yesterday for the first time since its IPO. It beat Wall Street expectations with quarterly net revenue of $40 million, plus it forecast juicy sales of over $210 million for the whole year. Net losses came to $6.6 million for the quarter. 

A lot has happened since the IPO
Beyond Meat (+14.87% after hours) has done remarkably well, up almost 300% from its IPO price at yesterday's close.

To appeal to more customers, fast food restaurants like Tim Hortons have announced partnerships with the brand, and Burger King launched its Impossible Whopper with Beyond Meat rival Impossible Foods. Some think McDonald‚Äôs is coming for Beyond next.

JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman told CNN the sky‚Äôs the limit for the industry, saying the overall fake meat sector could do over $100 billion in sales in 15 years. Beyond‚Äôs share of that veggie patty? 5%, Goldman thinks.
Zoom out: Those projections are so buoyant because customers are getting more concerned about 1) their health, although some in the industry say the fake meat burgers aren‚Äôt the healthiest choice, and 2) climate change. Meat production accounts for millions of metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year.

There are a few problems, though
One is the best kind; Beyond is having trouble filling all of its orders, a challenge Impossible ran into after it launched with Burger King. But making plants ‚Äúsizzle, sear and even bleed‚Äù like meat also requires high-tech production, which means meatless burgers are and will probably stay pricier than traditional ground beef.

Bottom line: Beyond is clearly riding a meatless wave, and it‚Äôs set the gold standard for 2019 IPOs.

+ Optional homework: If all this leaves you curious about the meat-that-was-once-an-animal industry and its efforts to thwart the plant and lab versions, the WaPo has a great look at it here.

            

 

 

TELECOM
Ajit Pai Wants to Clean Up Your "Recents" Tab
Yesterday, the FCC voted unanimously to allow phone companies to automatically block robocalls, your thrice-daily reminder that your phone can be used to speak with another human.

The agency decided that carriers can use analytics programs that target suspicious phone activity.

The programs can identify numbers that place unusually large volumes of calls at once, or that make large numbers of calls of the same, brief duration.
Chairman Ajit Pai believes robocall rage transcends differences, saying it ‚Äúunites Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, socialists and libertarians, vegetarians and carnivores, Ohio State and Michigan fans.‚Äù

But some people aren‚Äôt convinced this is the end of the $100 Bahamian vacation offers. It‚Äôs not clear if carriers will be able to effectively stop robocalls from abroad. And the FCC's two Democrats said customers shouldn‚Äôt be forced to pay to have robocalls filtered out; under yesterday‚Äôs decision, carriers can charge for the service.

Bottom line: You can plan on fewer calls from numbers suspiciously similar to mom‚Äôs, but it might cost you.

            

 

 

TECH
Cloudy With a Chance of Google

Anyone who went to Google News and Googled ‚ÄúGoogle news‚Äù yesterday knows yesterday‚Äôs Google news was all about the cloud.

Stadia gets its wings
Google‚Äôs March announcement of cloud-based game streaming service Stadia was heavy on the hype, light on the details. But now we know...

Stadia will start beaming 31+ high-end games in 14 countries in November.
An initial ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Edition‚Äù package runs $130 for a hardware starter kit and three months of premium service (after which it‚Äôll cost $10/month).
And one big cloud deal
Google is paying $2.6 billion to buy Looker, a data analytics platform aimed at beefing up Google Cloud‚Äôs offerings. It‚Äôs Google‚Äôs biggest acquisition since 2014‚Äôs $3.2 billion Nest deal.

Why now: Google Cloud has become a focal point as execs consider diversifying revenue away from digital ads‚Äîwhich today account for almost 85% of sales.

Yes, but...Google‚Äôs fallen well behind rivals Amazon and Microsoft in cloud leadership. Bloomberg‚Äôs Shira Ovide thinks M&A may not be able to make up the difference.

            

 

 

RETAIL
Don‚Äôt Judge a Buyout by Its Cover

Elliott Management is reportedly close to buying Barnes & Noble (+29.85%), per the WSJ. The FT says Elliott‚Äôs offer values the nation‚Äôs biggest bookstore chain at about $476 million.

This could be the life raft Barnes & Noble needs. The chain‚Äôs best known as Patient Zero of the Amazon Effect. Before it disrupted shopping or voice or Mother‚Äôs Day, Amazon flipped bookselling on its head.

The damning evidence: A little over a decade ago, Barnes & Noble was worth $3 billion. Now go back and look at the second sentence.
But if anyone can execute a turnaround at B&N, it might be Elliott. The $35 billion hedge fund bought U.K. book chain Waterstones last year and actually helped it rebound enough to...brace yourself...open new stores.

If the same happens at Barnes & Noble, more than just collectors of leather bound books will be celebrating. B&N‚Äôs 627 stores are critical to publishers, who rely on the chain for a) marketing and b) keeping Amazon from completely dictating book pricing.
