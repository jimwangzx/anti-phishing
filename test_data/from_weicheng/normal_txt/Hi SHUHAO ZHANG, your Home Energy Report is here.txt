2020 California Climate Credit
This month your electric bill will include a credit identified as the “California Climate Credit.” The electric credit is typically distributed in April and October, while the gas credit is typically only in April. The California Public Utility Commission worked with us to move up the October electric credit ($35.73) to be distributed in May ($17.87) and June ($17.86), split evenly between the two months.

Ways to Save
		
Clear area around heating and cooling vents
Furniture and carpets can block vents and prevent rooms from warming up or cooling down efficiently. If your home is heated or cooled through vents, move objects away from them to maximize circulation and save energy.
Save up to $25 per year
		
Close your shades in the summer
Sunlight passing through windows heats your home and makes your air conditioner work harder. You can block this heat by keeping blinds or drapes closed on sunny days.
Save up to $10 per year
		
Use a ceiling fan and raise the thermostat setting 4°F
ENERGY STAR® certified ceiling fans allow you to set your thermostat 4°F higher without sacrificing comfort. Adding fans to your home can keep you cool while reducing AC costs.
