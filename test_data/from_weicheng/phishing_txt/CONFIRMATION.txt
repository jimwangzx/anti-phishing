The liberal arts here are studied the way they were meant to be: as a means of understanding the good, the true, and the beautiful. You’ll study inescapably relevant ideas, whether they originated in Ancient Greece, the Renaissance, America’s founding era, or our own times. While liberal arts curricula at other universities take on contemporary works with temporary relevance, at Hillsdale you’ll explore timeless themes and learn from some of humanity’s greatest thinkers. That might read like a grand overstatement: trust us, it isn’t. Here, the questions are provocative, the debates robust, and the coursework intense. This journey is designed to lead you to universal truths. The Purpose of a Liberal Arts Education “A sound liberal arts education aims precisely to sharpen readers and thinkers in their use of such arguments and amusements. It aims to prepare minds and hearts for a world loud with all manner of persuasion, much of it good, much more of it not-so-good.” – Dr. David Whalen, Associate Vice President for Curriculum, Professor of English What You’ll Study There are fourteen specific courses that every Hillsdale student completes in the Humanities, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences as part of the core. In addition, you’ll chose one course in Fine Arts, one in Western Literature, one in the Social Sciences, and one Center for Constructive Alternatives seminar. Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) candidates will also meet a requirement in foreign language, while the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree candidates will place a heavy emphasis on laboratory science and mathematics courses. Naomi Virnelson “The intersection of my Western Religion and biochemistry core classes helped me to more fully integrate my faith and my scientific outlook.” In both her natural science and humanities classes, Naomi Virnelson encountered similar questions. Approaching them from different perspectives helped her develop a strong personal conviction. ----7bVaqerS;sRIVdR Your subscription to our list has been confirmed.
