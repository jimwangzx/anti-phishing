__label__1 b'by ben white 05162016 0800 am edt the weekend in trumpland just to review the new york times ran a long piece on saturday on donald trumps often gross treatment of women trump continues to deny that he used fake names to call reporters in the 1980s and 1990s to talk about himself even though he previously admitted it was him and it was obviously him trump continues to refuse to release his tax returns while claiming quite laughably that there is nothing to learn from them and trump continues to say he is completely flexible on the promises he made to gop voters in the primaries rnc chair reince priebus confronted with all this on abcs this week basically punted and said that in 2016 i dont think the traditional playbook applies to his credit priebus said trump would have to answer for his treatment of women but for the rest of it priebus suggested none if it will matter and voters will back trump as they did in the primaries because he will blow up the system in washington perhaps they will but the early numbers dont look good a poll out on sunday showed a dead heat in georgia a state democrats havent won since bill clinton in 1992 if hillary clinton can win in the south her already sizeable electoral college advantage could turn into a giant rout the counter argument is that trump could win florida and ohio and challenge clinton across the rust belt possibly but to do that trump would have to overcome huge losses in south florida and urban areas in the midwest trumps electoral map at this early stage looks daunting if not impossible

trump after long saying his selffinanced campaign shielded him from special interests is preparing to start raising large donations he reversed course he said in early may to ensure his campaign has the resources to compete with hillary clinton it might seem a strange reason for a man who says he is worth 10 billion but a close analysis of mr trumps finances shows that in terms of ready cash he would be illequipped to foot the bill himself when his campaign began last summer a financial disclosure mr trump filed said he had between about 78 million and 232 million in cash and relatively liquid assets such as stocks and bonds that would go fast if mr trump spent an amount close to the 721 million president barack obama spent in 2012 up to election day or the 449 million mitt romney spent in the same stretch this would leave hundreds of millions to be made up and mr trumps businesses dont produce that much in a year a wall street journal analysis shows his 2016 pretax income

first hedge fund managers to have signed up as a trump fundraiser anthony scaramucci has been telling peers that mr trump would soon make a dramatic shift in style while other backers said they expected the candidate to surround himself with experienced policy advisers jokes at mr trumps expense were more common than endorsements at last weeks lavish salt conference in las vegas which is run by mr scaramuccis skybridge capital but concern that hillary clinton would tack to the left to win over bernie sanders voters was also widespread both supporters and others at the event said they expected to see big differences between trump the candidate and trump the president link buffett wants yahoo nyts michael j de la merced yahoo appears to be making progress in efforts to sell itself despite some initial skepticism the latest piece of evidence among those vying for the company is the unusual combination of the investor warren e buffett and dan gilbert the founder of quicken loans and owner of the cleveland cavaliers that consortium is one of several suitors that have moved into the second round of bidding for yahoo according to people briefed on the matter mr gilbert is leading the bid said the people who were not authorized to speak publicly mr buffetts conglomerate berkshire hathaway is offering to provide financing as he has done with the investment firm 3g

__label__1 b'xrichfolks two points here 1 i read with some consternation wally broeckers latest piece in science 23feb 2001 first you can all take up some other topic since wally says only boreholes and treeline changes are accurate enough to do low frequency trends what does he mean by only two proxies can yield temperatures that are accurate to 05c and do you agree that tree rings and sediments etc are not sufficiently accurate to exhibit correct low frequency trends 2 here are some references to recent holocene timeframe records you probably have seen but just in case i found them interesting without knowing how good or representative they are surprisingly they were given me by one who cited them as examples of evidence for a mwp and lia i read them differently but they caused me to consider one question i hadnt heard discussed see below based just on these four one comes to the following tentative conclusions and observations conclusions mwp was a generally warm time interspersed with coolings and not well synchronized hemispherically or globally lia was global and capable of better but not completely synchronized large amplitude variations 20th cent was the only time when all records agree tree ring problems with co2 might this relative uniformity be used as a characteristic of 20th centu warming that sets it apart from previous climate changes borehole inversion is too smoothed to be of much use but it does indicate a larger temp amplitude if it werent smoothed 15c and this brings up my question how one averages these records one way would be to note that the temperature amplitude 1000 1950 for each is 15c thus you could conclude that hemisphericglobal climate varied ay over a degree celcius although with regional differences another way would be to average the records the resulting temperature amplitude would be smaller because extremes would cancel since variability is large and each regions extremes occur at different times thus if people simply looked at several records they would get the impression that temperature variations were large 15c imagine their surprise when they see that the ensemble averages you publish have much smaller amplitude comparison of amplitudes is given below although difficult to do since amplitude depends on averaging so these are very approximate approximate temperature amplitudes for period 10001950 mann et al 1999 05 jones et al 1998 08 crowley and lowery briffa 2000 dahl jensen 15 huang et al 08 500 yrs only overpeck et al 13 400 yrs polar only bradley jones93 07 600 yrs only not surprising that the contrarians take great exception to michaels small amplitude boldunderlinethis is important in the current debate even it would appear with people like wallyunderlinebold i have been looking for what the real issue is between researchers like yourselves and skeptical scientists politics and agendas aside i think it is close to this anyone looking at the records gets the impression that the temperature amplitude for many individual recordssites over the past 1000 years or so is often larger than 1c they thus recognize that natural variability is unlikely to generate such large changes unless the sun is having more effect than direct forcing or there is some fortuitous but detectable combination of forcings and they see this as evidence that the 08c or so temperature rise in the 20th century is not all that special the community however in making ensemble averages gets a much smaller amplitude 05c which they say shows that reasonable combinations of solar direct plus volcanos and internal variability with the help of thc can indeed explain this and the 20th century warming is unique thus the impassone side pointing to large temperature variations in many records around the globe and the other saying yes but not synchronous and so averaged hemispherically no big deal but just replying that lack of synchronous events sometimes by a few decades is the reason might not be enough it seems to me that we must go one step further we must address the question what forcings can generate large amplitude temperature variations over hundreds of years regional though they may be and could these occur at different times in different regions due to shifting heat inertia patterns if we cant do this then there might be something wrong with our rationale that the average is low amplitude even though many regions see high amplitude this may be the nubbin of the disagreement and until we answer it many careful scientists will decide the issue is still unsettled and that indeed climate in the past may well have varied as much or more than in the last hundred years also i note that most proxy temperature records claim timing errors of 50 years or so what is the possibility that records are cancelling each other out on variations in the hundred year frame due simply to timing errors as in hitting or missing cls triple warming peak

national polllink democratic frontrunner hillary clinton leads republican frontrunner donald trump by double digits in a new cnnorc national poll as the 2016 race turns toward the general election clinton earns 54 percent support while trump garners 41 percent support the numbers come as trumps main rival sen ted cruz dropped out of the race virtually clearing the way for trump to clinch the nomination clintons delegate lead over rival sen bernie sanders is also nearly insurmountable despite her loss in indiana tuesday bernie sanders bernie sanders celebrates indiana win criticizes closed primarieslink sen bernie sanders said his 5point win in indianas democratic presidential primary on tuesday will help him pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the united states sanders acknowledged that his path to the nomination is narrow but pledged to fight for every vote he called on clinton to debate him in delegaterich california where he said he will hold large rallies ahead of the states primary in june sanders said he has enough money to fund a winning campaign for the remaining contests one problem for sanders though is that only four of the remaining democratic nominating contests are open or semiopen to independents who largely favor sanders in indianas primary which also was open 72 of independent voters surveyed in a cnn exit poll said they supported sanders republican party candidates ted cruz ted cruzs epic downfall how the texas senator took donald trump to the brink and then watched it all fall apartlink it seems strange to say this about the man who until last night was one of the last three people standing in a republican presidential primary that has come to resemble a cross between rollerball and insult night at the local chuckle hut but ted cruz was always a terrible candidate for the gop nomination over the past couple of weeks cruzs ineptness has already become crystal clear as his campaign has imploded he has flailed harder and harder in search of some gamechanging moment to keep him going he made noise about a contested convention and worked hard to plant his loyalists among the state delegations that will vote for the nominee in cleveland even as voters were telling him they hate that idea he selected carly fiorina as a vicepresidential running mate a move so desperate its a wonder that every tv in america didnt start leaking flop sweat whenever images of the two together appeared on their screens john kasich john kasich suspending campaign source to nbc newslink ohio gov john kasich has cancelled a planned event to make a wednesday night statement in ohio nbc reported kasich was left the only man standing against donald trump in the republican presidential primary race after sen ted cruz of texas suspended his run on tuesday night trump won a resounding victory on tuesday night in indiana taking all 57 of the states gop delegates according to nbc in response cruz suspended his run concluding that he had there was no longer a viable path to his becoming the republican standardbearer in the general election donald trump donald trump needs a running mate here are four names for him to considerlink will donald trump ever be presidential in the conventional manner we have come to expect its a path he may never follow but after his victory in indiana on tuesday night and ted cruzs decision to suspend his campaign there is now rampant speculation as to what presidential will mean should trumps executive desk move to the oval office as with any presidential nominee the selection of their vice presidential running mate is important because it offers us a window into their thinking trump recently gave some insight into his thoughts on the matter when he told neil cavuto on the fox business network i would want to choose a politician im a businessman i dont think we need two guys like me here are four individuals who may very well get the call from the

satisfied with the cost of their plans premium while half of respondents are satisfied with the cost of their deductible but researchers note that respondents were slightly more dissatisfied with their premium and deductible costs in 2015 than they were in 2014 one potential explanation there was a more than 30 percent surge in enrollment in highdeductible plans which expose customers to higher care costs and despite broad focus on narrow networks at least 74 percent of shoppers were satisfied with their choice of primary care doctors or hospitals in their networks they were a little more concerned about availability of specialists only 59 percent of respondents said they were happy with their specialist options see the survey link oklahoma passes bill making performing abortions

__label__1 b'xflowed hi tim thanks for looking into this so quickly i agree w your assessment it is probably just the fact that the signal of interest in soi and nino3 is really the interannual signal and this is not evident in the lowfrequency component shown which emphasizes discrepancies that are actually small compared to amplitude of the interannual signal present in both stahle et al and mann et al so i would urge showing the annual reconstructions in this case rather than smoothed for this reason in ipcc we only chose to show 1700 to present which is a better calibratedverified interval than back to 1650 so id encourage you guys to restrict it to 1700present if you can other than that i think it is important to acknowledge that soi and nino3 have different lowfrequency trends over the 20th century and might well have different trends in the past it is true that many of the proxies used are sensitive to the soi eg mexican tree rings but others are sensitive to pacific sst eg corals from gbr new caledonia galapagos and our claim is that the calibration process will select out the best estimate of the temperature patterns rather than slp patterns associated w enso from the multiproxy network in the future well be going after slp reconstruction too and itll be interesting to see what the difference is i hope that clarifies please let me know if i can be of any further help provide further clarification etc thanks again mike'

__label__1 b'cated myself to the cause of the national socialist movement i designed a massive website that received 30005000 views daily the zogs nightmare vi deogames shot and edited dozens of videos sponsored 6 events and rallies in the northwest made 74 radio shows and spent thousands on the cause of national socialism now i have been discarded and treated like a jew by the same organization i have spent nearly every spare second working for many people have heard rumorsbut few know what really happened jeff schoep and his internetbullyboy john schafer have been working overtime to silenc e me it will not work the truth will be toldhere is how i went from be ing one of jeff schoeps closet personal advisors to one of his many enemie s rivaling that of bill whiteit all started when a young woman i had a sho rt termrelationship with wanted to do some volunteer work to help out the partyfirst remember when jeff or anyone say the party they really mean our business which is nsm records in 2006 nsm records did over 110000 in sales and the rumor is that the current projections for this year are a round 180000 nsm records is a business that doesnt report total profit s to the members so nobody knows just how much is going in and what its be ing spent on not even colonel bishop knows the final numbers only jeff an d john nsm members are expected to just smile and just hope commander is s pending the money wiselyanyway this young woman contacted the guy the who runs the forums to get involved john schafer aka reichsmarshal johnny is the server administrator for new saxon nsm forum and nsm88records is al so coowner of a business and he doesnt want this fact advertised john is a net nazi whom has never been to any nsm rally or gathering john was inf ormed that this woman was involved with jim ramm but he still tried despera tely to put the moves on her john did his best attempting to brainwash her against me and her friends but it didnt work when i found out about the acts of severe dishonor i informed commander schoep schoep phoned her and investigated he later told other members in the party that the dishonor ne ver happened and the woman said it was a mistake schoep lied for john and it wasnt the first time but why would he do this john is a talented but lonely hackergeek who has nearly godlike abilities on the internet egoma niac john schafer has a fiberoptic connection into his house at 38 wilson dr berkeley heights nj 07922 at that location he has the servers that ru n new saxon nsm 88 records and the main nsm site johns business is calle d sche4fer gerig associates sga and he rumors to have some nonwhite clients phone 973 6987542 home phone 908 4640920at this point i d ecided to take a leave of absence from the nsm and get out quietly while ca using the least amount of harm to the party i redesigned nukeisrael and re moved all links to the nsm however schoep was very angry he directed scha fer to hack into the account where nukeisrael was located and change the re gistration password username and redirect the site to the nsm88records mo neymachine they then made up some lie about how i was encouraging genocid e to use as justification for the outright theft of nukeisrael which has al ways been my site unfortunately the domain name was registered in canada which makes it extremely unlikely that the canadian government will pressur e the us government to extradite john schafer for breaking canadian law nu keisrael was once estimated to bring in at a domain name auction between 2 2003000 this site was never donated to the nsm it was always registered in my name until schafer stole it and transferred everything this isnt t he first domain name schafer ever stole after the eric adams scandal eric was accused of theft by schoep who provided no evidence john schafer hack ed into and stole outright 6 domains that eric had owned his skills for ev il on a computer cannot be overestimated schafer is very good at the crime s he commitsrefusing to be treated like a nigger jim ramm fought back i converted bill whitewatch into nsm watch and begin to tell the truth about what had happened unfortunately i underestimated schafers abilities and h e also broke into the blogger account probally using a password guessing pr ogram the blog site is now a nsm propaganda site he even broke into my ya hoo email addresss and stole that also thinking he would completely silence me from telling the truth about the crooks in the nsm it didnt work and i am now openly speaking out against the nsm backstabbers whom will gladly screw their own white brother for a buck over a hundred nsm members have now quit over this scandal and others that popped up about the same time n ick chapell resigned and with him went the nsm meeting hall in laurens sc presidential candidate taylor bowles has resigned and many more people too numerous to mention the nsm is truly imploding and nick and taylor have starting a new organization called the national socialist order of america that i urge all current and former nsm members to join website link lesforpresidentcom if that site ever gets hacked we will all know who di d itnsm members make no mistake jeff schoep is in this just for the money and he really doesnt give a damn about the white race devilworshiper ch airman herrington never left the party and is still actively involved herr ington still owns and controls the national socialist movement and uses jef f schoep as his proxy your donations to the nsm and the nsm 88records prof its are going to buy jeffie toys and pay for the joy of satan devilgroup t hat is run by herringtons mentallyill wife i underestimated john schafer once and that wont happen again zogs nightmare will be soon available f ree online that will put a damper on videogame salesschoep and schafer might have won a battle but we are in it for the long haul and will win t he war heil victory against

__label__1 b'trumps campaign dwarfed by clintons by kenneth p vogel and isaac arnsdorf 05212016 1225 am edt at the outset of the general election hillary clintons campaign looks like a welloiled juggernaut next to donald trumps vastly smaller selffunded operation a politico analysis of federal election commission reports filed friday found through the end of last month the period covered by the most recent fec filings trumps campaign had spent less than a third as much clintons 57 million to 182 million and had assembled a staff about onetenth the size of her 70 employees to 732 with a fraction as many offices trump last month paid 101000 in rent vs 328000 for clinton the analysis found trump a billionaire rookie candidate whose own money had accounted for 75 percent of the 59 million brought in by his campaign is moving quickly to buttress his campaign operations partly by launching a fundraising and field operation in coordination with the republican national committee he did little to assemble the trappings of a traditional campaign during a chaotic primary during which he dispatched 17 rivals for the republican presidential nomination many of whom ran more traditional and expensive campaigns the 57 million trump had spent through the end of april is only slightly more than the 54 million spent by florida sen marco rubio who dropped out of the race more than two months ago and its far less than the 81 million spent by ted cruz the texas senator assembled a sophisticated microtargeting machine that helped keep in the race until he dropped out this month after being trounced by trump in the indiana primary last month as trump was struggling to put away cruz trumps campaign spent 27 million on advertising while clinton spent 12 million on digital and broadcast media buys as she worked to put away her rival for the democratic nomination vermont sen bernie sanders yet clintons campaign appeared to be preparing for the general election spending far less than sanders whose 207 million in total spending marks him as the cycles biggest spender he continued spending briskly in april dropping 386 million as compared to 239 million for clinton sanders spent almost twice as much as clinton on media and payroll despite a slightly smaller staff as well as more on online advertising and direct mail as a result sanders entered this month with only 58 million in the bank compared to clintons 30 million additionally unlike either sanders or trump both of whom have eschewed super pacs clinton is backed by the deeppocketed priorities usa action it raised 86 million last month more than a third of which came from univision chairman haim saban and his wife cheryl according to its fec report which showed it finished last month with 47 million in the bank a handful of super pacs are vying to raise big money for trump but they have gotten off to a slow start as theyve struggled with inighting and clinton also has a massive head start over trump when it come to analytics polling and building models of likely voters and turnout plans trump who only recently hired a pollster still had not spent a dime on polling through the end of last month while clinton spent 896000 in april alone trump did start beefing up other areas of his operation last month his fec report showed for instance he spent 931000 on direct mail as compared to only 398000 spent by clinton according to her report and trump continued to be among the biggest spenders in field on branded merchandise including his signature make america great again hats his campaign last month spent 856000 on hats tshirts mugs and stickers versus the 88000 clinton spent on merchandise to view online link to change your alert settings please go to link or link email was sent to userdomaincom by politico llc 1000 wilson blvd arlington va 22209 usa to unsubscribelink'

__label__1 b'thanks ben for this hi all and happy new year i had a similar experiencebut not foia since we at climatic change are a private institutionwith stephen mcintyre demanding that i have the mann et al cohort publish all their computer codes for papers published in climatic change i put the question to the editorial board who debated it for weeks the vast majority opinion was that scientists should give enough information on their data sources and methods so others who are scientifically capable can do their own brand of replication work but that this does not extend to personal computer codes with all their undocumented sub routines etc it would be odious requirement to have scientists document every line of code so outsiders could then just apply them instantly not only is this an intellectual property issue but it would dramatically reduce our productivity since we are not in the business of producing software products for general consumption and have no resources to do so the nsf which funded the studies i published concurredso that ended that issue with climatic change at the time a few years ago this continuing pattern of harassment as ben rightly puts it in my opinion in the name of due diligence is in my view an attempt to create a fishing expedition to find minor glitches or unexplained bits of codewhich exist in nearly all our kinds of complex workand then assert that the entire result is thus suspect our best way to deal with this issue of replication is to have multiple independent author teams with their own codes and data sets publishing independent work on the same topicslike has been done on the hockey stick that is how credible scientific replication should proceed let the lawyers figure this out but be sure that like ben is doing now you disclose the maximum reasonable amount of information so competent scientists can do replication work but short of publishing undocumented personalized codes etc the end of the email ben attached shows their intentto discredit papers so they have no evidentiary value in public policywhat you resort to when you cant win the intellectual battle scientifically at ipcc or nas good luck with this and expect more of it as we get closer to international climate policy actions we are witnessing the contrarian battle of the bulge now and expect that all weapons will be used cheers steve ps please do not copy or forward this email stephen h schneider melvin and joan lane professor for interdisciplinary environmental studies professor department of biology and senior fellow woods institute for the environment mailing address yang yamazaki environment energy building mc 4205 473 via ortega ph 650 725 9978 f 650 725 4387 websites climatechangenet patientfromhellorg'

__label__1 b'hi david thanks for the detailed response ill try to be brief on the orbital forcing you write the point here is that climate can be forced by other factors than simply a global annual average radiation change which is the metric now being used i think we all agree on this point my concern is only about how to present it in the section i think that giving a climate sensitivity wrt global mean orbital forcing is confusing to the uninitiated eg your statement in the section this high climate sensitivity 2c wm2 is occurring in an atmospheric model echam1 whose sensitivity to doubled co2 is about 06cwm2 i really think we should not give a number like 2c wm2 as climate sensitivity to globalmean orbital forcing and contrast it to that to doubled co2 it gives out the message to people that climate sensitivity is all over the place and ill defined thats not the case climate sensitivity is a welldefined concept for a globally uniform forcing like co2 forcing but nobody expects any clear relation between the global mean part of orbital forcing and the climate response on uncoupled models i agree that for 2xco2 runs you will get very similar climate sensitivity with uncoupled and coupled models because there is no large change in ocean heat transport between equilibrium 1x and 2x co2 states as confirmed by doing this in coupled models the mixed layer boundary condition used in the uncoupled models simply assumes a fixed prescribed ocean heat transport which turns out to be a valid approximation in this case my concern was and is specific to the discussion for lgm climate where this is not a valid approximation as we know both from proxy data and from model results that ocean circulation and heat transport was very likely quite different in the lgm compared to today in our nature 98 lgm simulation we get 50 difference in the response of the northern hemisphere mean temperature between the uncoupled mixed layer experiment and the one that includes the ocean model 50 is a firstorder difference and hence i think that all the evidence we have today points to the constant heat transport approximation breaking down when applied to the lgm the ipcc report should not draw conclusions about climate sensitivity from lgm experiments that have made this approximation as i think those would be hard to defend i must say im starting to get a little concerned about the chapter discussing 1980s papers for no other apparent reason then them being authored by rind while leaving out important more recent widely recognised advances in the field i attach the schneider et al paper i announced earlier submitted to science today and arguable the most comprehense study on deriving climate sensitivity from lgm data constraints that has been done so far on the directionality of the cimate sensitivity of course i understand the reasons the ice feedback and water vapor feedback etc ive written about those myself in the past again this is only a difference in how best to present the same undisputed facts you make the argument that when going to a colder climate sensitivity is different from when going to a warmer climate that is undisputed but that in my view has nothing to do with the direction of the experiment but with the fact that sensitivity in a colder climate is different from sensitivity in a warmer climate i explained with the ppm example because i thought thats simple a directionality would be if going from 280 to 300 ppm would give a different equilibrium response compared to going from 300 to 280 but thats not what youre talking about your talking about going from 280 to 260 say as compared to going from 280 to 300 that of course gives different results because the difference 280260 applies to a colder climate than the difference 300280 no matter in which direction you derive this stefan'

__label__1 b'xflowed hi eyestein thanks for your comments with respect to the suggested changes in paragraphs 12 and 4 they seem fine to me however i think we need to include in paragraph 5 potential reasons as to why the substantial and not just significant high latitude warming that appears in the midpliocene record is not produced in gcms in response to higher co2 in general otherwise we leave the reader with a big question and no possible solution the tendency of gcm simulations for the future climate to produce an nadw decrease forces those simulations to have minimal high latitude warming in the north atlantic exactly opposite the inference from the pliocene paleorecord which is quite robust in this respect at least if the pliocene record is indicating the opposite of what current models are predicting it may be offering us a valuable clue the suggested reasons also include the comment that the lack of land ice at high northern latitudes might be a strong contributing cause which would make it a noanalog situation and hence not fully a gcm problem i would favor leaving those two sentences as they were david'

potential cause of the egyptair crash over the mediterranean fears are growing that the crash may have been an act of terrorism and lawmakers are taking a closer look at potential security gaps at airports in north africa our own jennifer scholtes spoke with house homeland security chairman mike mccaul who said he fears americans could be in danger if it was a bomb it probably would have been put on the plane in cairo or paris mccaul said thats my biggest concern cairo has flights into jfk and theyre going to open another one at dulles as long as we have flights coming directly to the united states i think its putting americans at risk insights from a recent codel mccaul and other members of congress actually visited north africa earlier this month jen writes that the delegation checked out transportation hubs including cairo international airport and found inadequate screening equipment and aviation workers that arent thoroughly vetted passengers embarking from cairo are screened only by a magnetometer rather than fullbody scanners that can detect nonmetallic bombs and aviation workers arent checked against us intelligence information or databases the texas republican noted lawmakers have been pressuring tsa to send extra screening equipment to overseas ports where security is wanting but the agency has been slow to comply mccaul said he added that he plans to personally pester tsa administrator peter neffenger about his agencys timeline and also send an official letter to tsa theres been a sixmonth delay in getting these full body scanner machines he said that needs to be expedited and then i think the vetting of their employees the latest updates egyptian officials also believe that terrorism is looking like an increasingly likely cause of the crash from the guardian egypts aviation minister sherif fathi said he did not want to prematurely draw conclusions but added the possibility of having a different action or a terror attack is higher than the possibility of having a technical failure and from the washington post shortly after entering egyptian airspace the plane made sudden swerves and dropped from 37000 feet to 15000 feet said greeces

its transportation spending bill on thursday action is now headed to the house where lawmakers are tentatively expected to mark up their appropriations bill in the full committee next week the dramafree final vote was reflective of a week with few of the theatrical snarls that mucked up the senates energy and water appropriations bill earlier this month the one point of contention a controversial trucking measure on hours of service was included in the bill without much opposition a fact that road safety advocates say belies the trucking industrys cozy relationship with leaders in congress safety advocates lob accusations im not going to reveal what members of congress have told me because i dont want to hurt their confidences but we know that this is a very traditional problem joan claybrook chairwoman of citizens for reliable and safe highways and former nhtsa administrator told reporters on a conference call earlier this week she said other members of congress didnt publicly fight the trucking provision out of fear that projects in their states wouldnt get funded we just know that the power of the subcommittee chairmen is very large and subcommittee chairwoman susan collins has been an advocate for years of antisafety provisions that the trucking industry wants from collins spokeswoman annie clark it is incredibly dishonest that this same safety group who criticized the last bill saying it would let truckers drive 80 plus hours a week with a restart has come out in opposition to this cap clark said in an email adding that the group is rapidly losing credibility a4a wont take it lying down as senators continue to accuse airlines of failing to pull their weight in the battle against airport security wait times they want airlines to waive checked bag fees for the summer airlines for america is throwing shade right back saying in a letter to sen dick durbin dill that much of the blame for the lengthy lines lies with congress citing the bipartisan budget act of 2013 a4as nicholas calio said lawmakers diverted 13 billion of passenger security fee revenue over 10 years to pay for deficit reduction that decision has come home to roost calio said if congress wanted to take constructive and welljustified action it would immediately pass legislation putting that money paid by airline passengers where it belongs hands off our baggage fees a4as statement also delivered a blowbyblow rebuttal to the request for waived baggage fees the excessive airport security lines are a recent development whereas the model of charging customers for services they use and value like checking a bag has been in place since 2008 the organization wrote adding that tsa data shows that the number of checked bags has hardly changed in the past six years not only does the data not support a causal relationship between recent lines and baggage fees it would be illegal for airlines to jointly agree on any pricing policy including bag fees the

out loud where it was coincidence definitely but that wont stop us from taking credit not much changed in the plan other than some shuffling around of the first phases of the 15part schedule and now the agency is looking at a june 4 start date for the projects first safety surge from rep gerry connolly dva we cannot focus only on track and infrastructure repairs a complete systemwide change in culture is necessary at all levels of metro the success of safetrack demands an open and transparent process but most important it will require a robust communications strategy that regularly informs the public as we move through this unprecedented maintenance and rebuilding plan a cautionary tale as one of 10 public transit administrators crowded onto a conference call hosted by the american public transportation association on thursday washington metro general manager paul wiedefeld offered up his rail system as the perfect cautionary tale for what could happen to transit systems if managers dont address maintenance backlogs or receive the necessary funding to perform widespread maintenance work we have to catch up so thats what well do wiedefeld said talking about the widespread shutdowns planned for the safetrack plan for this infrastructure here we are the example of what occurs when you do not do that the deterioration of service and the need to take drastic action there but for the grace other public transit administrators seemed to emit a palpable air of relief that their systems plagued with their own maintenance problems to be sure had at least avoided the fate of washingtons metro with its daylong emergency shutdown that made headlines nationwide dorval carter president of the chicago transit authority i think in many ways residents of dc are starting to experience the types of challenges that legacy systems have experienced for quite some time jeffrey knueppel general manager of septa in philadelphia had a heartening note after years of annual shutdowns to conduct maintenance he said the number of customer complaints about the service interruptions dropped dramatically our customers have learned to deal with the fact that we have this trolley tunnel blitz every year and customer complaints are going down and down and down every year because we promise to have fewer outages for the rest of the year it takes people time to adjust to the need to do these things regularly so heres hoping wmata riders as for apta the beleaguered transit advocacy organization is laying it on thick as it endeavors to prove to members that its turning a new leaf after it was dumped by new yorks metropolitan transportation authority and after the abrupt resignation of former president ceo michael melaniphy in an email to members this week apta outlined a slew of soulsearching measures new task forces and upcoming meetings as well as a laundry list of dozens of public transit agencies lobbying groups and think tanks that apta said it had communicated with and presumably said they wouldnt abandon the advocacy organization in the near future they also highlighted potential new members including european railway manufacturer skoda

houses of congress in tuesdays us elections picking up five more seats in the senate and adding at least 18 more seats in the house of representatives the next session of congress will include 45 jewish lawmakers a new record after democrats alan grayson of florida and john adler of new jersey took two house seats from the republican column jared polis also a democrat was widely expected to win his colorado house seat to match the previous record set in the 2006 elections the house will have 32 jewish members only the class of 1990 had more jewish members 34 but there were fewer jewish senators at the time the next senate will have 13 jewish members the same as the previous session despite a tossup race in minnesota where both republican incumbent norm coleman and his democratic challenger comedian al franken are jewish democrats said they were disappointed not to have an even larger record after losing several close races including in alaska where polls showed state legislator ethan berkowitz mounting a strong challenge for a republican seat in vicepresidential nominee sarah palins home state but said they were satisfied with the outcome its a lot to ask we had an incredible night with obama we had the other pickups in the house and senate and we should be very grateful said ira forman executive direction of the national jewish democratic council the reinforced democratic majorities in both chambers assure presidentelect barack obama a stronger hand in enacting his agenda of change the publics expectations were high that democrats in congress will help obama follow through on campaign promises to end the longrunning war in iraq and fix the financial ills that many blame on bush and his party democrats increased their count in the 100seat upper house to at least 56 they currently have a 5149 majority including two independents who vote in their caucus three senate races with republican incumbents remained undecided among them the contentious reelection bid by 84yearold sen ted stevens of alaska the longestserving senate republican who was convicted last month of lying on senate forms to hide favors he received from a contractor races in georgia oregon and minnesota were too close to call the associated press called the senate race in minnesota prematurely republican sen norm coleman finished ahead of democrat al franken the former saturday night live comedian in the final vote count but colemans 571vote margin falls within the states mandatory recount law despite the strong showing democrats appeared to be falling short of their goal of taking 60 senate seats a 6040 majority would make it nearly impossible for the opposition to use procedural maneuvers to block democratic proposals from coming to a vote in the lower chamber the house of representatives the democrats expanded their majority by dominating the northeast and ousting republicans in every region the democrats added at least 18 seats to the 30 they took from republicans in 2006 fewer than 10 races remained undecided republicans were on track for their smallest numbers since 1994 the year the socalled republican revolution retook the house for the first time in 40 years the democratic edge in the current congress is 235199 with one vacancy in a formerly democratic seat two louisiana seats one democratic and one republican wont be decided until december because hurricanes postponed their primaries until tuesday the american people have called for a new direction they have called for change in america said house speaker nancy pelosi it was the first time in more than 75 years that democrats were on track for big house gains in backtoback elections this will be a wave upon a wave pelosi said house republicans were licking their wounds and hoping to increase their numbers in the 2010 election we sort of got through this we think a little bit better than some people might have expected said rep tom cole of oklahoma the head of the republican house campaign committee our worst days are behind us he added the democratic victories in the senate included an upset in north carolina by democratic state legislator kay hagan who unseated sen elizabeth dole one of the biggest names in the republican party and wife of bob dole the partys 1996 presidential nominee elizabeth dole a former cabinet secretary in two republican administrations had been criticized for spending little time in recent years in her home state in virginia former democratic gov mark warner breezed to victory over another former governor republican jim gilmore in the race to replace retiring fiveterm republican sen john w warner the two warners are not related in the west two udalls were elected to the senate in colorado mark udall son of the late arizona rep morris mo udall took the seat vacated by retiring republican sen wayne allard his cousin tom udall whose father stewart udall was interior secretary in the kennedy administration took the new mexico senate seat vacated by retiring republican sen pete domenici in new hampshire republican sen john sununu lost to democrat jeanne shaheen in a rematch that saw shaheen referring to sununu as bushs evil twin senate majority leader harry reid a nevada democrat attributed the partys gains to obamas coattails its been a really good night reid told the associated press obama ran a terrific campaign he inspired millions of people he said according to other preliminary counts 12 democrats retained their seats and 14 republicans were reelected or won seats vacated by retiring republicans among the republican survivors was sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky who outpolled millionaire businessman bruce lunsford to retain his seat mcconnell the senate minority leader is a master strategist and could be a thorn in the side of the democrats winston churchill once said the most exhilarating feeling in life is to be shot at and missed mcconnell said after the last few months i think he really meant to say there is nothing more exhausting this election has been both he added in minnesota voters cast nearly 29 million ballots prompting a recount that could take weeks to complete there is reason to believe that the recount could change the vote tallies significantly franken said in a statement the democratic winners included obamas running mate joe biden of delaware who was elected to his seventh senate term on tuesday but must give up his seat now that he will become vice president the states governor will likely appoint a fellow democrat to fill bidens seat until 2010 when a new election will be held a total of 35 seats were in contention in the senate in the house all 435 seats were up for election the defeat of 22year veteran rep chris shays in connecticut gave democrats every house seat from the northeastern new england states democratic businessman jim himes won despite republican shays recent highly publicized criticism of mccains presidential campaign the democrat also won an open seat in the new york city borough of staten island giving them control of all of the citys congressional delegation in washington for the first time in 35 years the incumbent republican rep vito fossella was forced to resign amid drunk driving charges and revelations that he fathered a child from an extramarital affair elsewhere in the northeast republican reps john r kuhl of new york and phil english of pennsylvania were defeated in the south democrats took seats in alabama north carolina and virginia in florida two republican incumbents were defeated by democrats including rep tom feeney who was under fire for ties to a disgraced lobbyist in the midwest democrats captured one seat in illinois and two seats each in michigan and ohio rep steve chabot a 14year veteran lost in a district that includes portions of cincinnati which has the largest black population of any congressional district in the nation held by a republican obamas candidacy was a major factor in the race where state sen steven driehaus won election democrats also made inroads in the west where they captured two new mexico seats one seat each in colorado and nevada and one left open in arizona by retiring republican rep rick renzi who is awaiting trial on corruption charges among the handful of losing democratic incumbents was rep tim mahoney in florida

__label__1 b'trump campaign eyes nevertrump blacklist by kenneth p vogel and ben schreckinger 05132016 0511 am edt donald trumps campaign is considering hitting his republican enemies where it hurts their wallets as trump moves to work in closer concert with the republican national committee apparatus some campaign aides and allies are pushing him to block lucrative party contracts from consultants who worked to keep him from winning the nomination according to four sources familiar with the discussions the never trump vendors and supporters shouldnt be in striking distance of the rnc any of its committees or anyone working on behalf of donald trump said a trump campaign official the blacklist talk which sources say mostly targets operatives who worked for never trump groups but also some who worked for trumps gop presidential rivals or their supportive super pacs strikes against a republican consulting class that trump has assailed as a pillar of a corrupt political establishment its a sweet bit of turnabout for trump aides and consultants who in recent months were warned that their work for the antiestablishment billionaire real estate showman could diminish their own career prospects if trumps team makes good on the blacklist it could elevate a whole new crop of vendors while penalizing establishment operatives who attacked him often in deeply personal terms but it also could put trumps campaign at a competitive disadvantage as it scrambles to quickly beef up capabilities in highly technical campaign tactics that it largely eschewed in the primary including voter data direct mail and phone banking newly minted presidential nominees typically install staff at their respective parties national committees and have been known to steer contracts to at least some of their favored vendors which often provokes backlash since trump all but clinched the gop nomination this month with a lopsided victory in indianas primary his staffers including political director rick wiley have spent considerable time at the rncs capitol hill headquarters discussing joint fundraising and field operations the trump campaign did not respond to questions about preferred vendors sources in and around the campaign told politico that the campaign was not going to try to enforce a blanket blacklist for all consultants who opposed trump but rather would make contracting decisions on a casebycase basis with those associated with harderhitting attacks more likely to be barred some of the consultants and firms that worked against trump are industry leaders in their respective fields including strategist katie packer pollster the tarrance group online fundraiser campaign solutions and data vendors targetpoint and targeted victory together the consultants and firms this year have been paid at least 432000 by the leading antitrump super pac our principles pac which pales in comparison to the 16 million their firms have collected over the years from the rnc according to a politico analysis of federal election commission filings packer who helped run our principles pac said she has no interest in working for trump nor do those i know who worked against him so it wouldnt bother her one bit to be on a trump blacklist i just hope they put me at the top and spell my name correctly she said adding winning a presidential election is hard they should focus on that and worry about settling scores if they win but targetpoint which has been paid at least 156000 this year by our principles pac as compared to at least 98 million over the years by the rnc would welcome the chance to continue its relationship with the national party during trumps campaign said brent seaborn a partner at the firm we have built a lot and have a lot planned and i would hate to see that not developed so i certainly hope that we continue with that work he said officials from the tarrance group and campaign solutions declined to say whether they would work for a trumpled rnc zac moffatt president of targeted victory said that his firm merely rented email lists to our principles for which it has been paid 22000 through the end of march the period covered by the most recent fec filings the firm has been paid more than that 141000 by the trump campaign for processing online donations moffatt pointed out though he acknowledged it was more involved in the presidential campaign of trumps bitter rival ted cruz which paid 53 million to targeted victory for digital advertising and fundraising nonetheless moffatt said he hopes targeted victory will be able to play a role in the general election with the rnc which over the years has paid the firm 33 million with the partys convention committees paying targeted victory another 208000 to assist with their web presences that includes 8000 from the 2016 convention committee for setting up a tumblr page of course we would work for the rnc under trump said moffatt he is our nominee and we have been building our 120plusperson company to prepare for the general for the past four years i would think the party and the campaign would want to best team available to complement their efforts where they see needs rnc chief strategist sean spicer said that senior trump campaign officials have assured him there is no list of firms they do not want the party committee to use there has been no discussion of not using any vendors pro or con he said but some of trumps close allies are publicly accusing republican leaders including rnc chairman reince priebus of trying to block trumps campaign from making rnc contracting decisions partly by withholding key endorsements like that of house speaker paul ryan with whom trump met thursday at the rnc this is really about the money at the rnc trump confidant roger stone alleged in a littlenoticed online interview this week millions and millions and millions of dollars that reince and ryan want to hand out to favored vendors so they are going to try to game plan trump theyre going to try to barter paul ryans endorsement in return for financial control and autonomy for the rnc the republican national committee that would be an egregious mistake in my opinion but this is part and parcel of the establishment effort to slow down donald trump the doling out of lucrative contracts to wellconnected firms is a perennial source of friction in washington politics in past years contracts awarded by the rnc to fls connect llc while its former partner rich beeson served as the committees political director have come under scrutiny as have contracts awarded to operative blaise hazelwoods husband when hazelwood worked at the rnc and the national republican senatorial committee this is again one of those issues that the rnc has to be cognizant of because those old cozy relationships are part of the problem and trump has effectively run on that said michael steele a former rnc chairman who made discontent with the committees handling of vendor relationships a theme of his campaign for that post youre probably going to see a lot of that stuff get exposed or dealt with in some way but another gop digital strategist cast these political consulting blacklists as folly he pointed to the relationship between an antitrump super pac and a firm cofounded last year by gerrit lansing before he became the rncs chief digital officer the firm an online payment platform called revv processed donations at nevertrumpcom the website for never means never pac an antitrump group seeded with 100000 from pierre omidyar the founder of ebay and first look media lansing has had no ties to revv since joining the rnc last summer he did not respond to a request for comment with revv doing never trump you have to ask yourself is the rnc on the blacklist too asked the strategist the idea of a blacklist doesnt make any sense because no 1 its illinformed and no 2 it doesnt reflect the marketplace plus the trump camps desire for revenge could run up against the businessmans pledge to surround himself with the best people in the case of lansing who worked at the national republican congressional committee before the rnc trump

__label__1 b'dear friends and colleagues this will be the last from me for the moment and i believe we are all arriving at a consensus voiced by tom barrie neville et al from excellent discussions firstly both danny and tom have complained to de freitas about his editorial decision which does not uphold the principles of good science tom has shared the response i would be curious to find out who the other four cited are but a rebuttal would be excellent ignoring bad science eventually reinforces the apparent truth of that bad science in the public mind if it is not corrected as importantly the bad science published by cr is used by the sceptics lobbies to prove that there is no need for concern over climate change since the ipcc makes it quite clear that there are substantial grounds for concern about climate change is it not partially the responsibility of climate science to make sure only satisfactorily peerreviewed science appears in scientific publications and to refute any inadequately reviewed and wrong articles that do make their way through the peer review process i can understand the weariness which the ongoing sceptics onslaught would induce in anyone scientist or not but thats no excuse for ignoring bad science it wont go away and the more we ignore it the more traction it will gain in the minds of the general public and the unfccc negotiators if science doesnt uphold the purity of science who will we australasians including tom as an ex pat have suggested some courses of action over to you now in the north to assess the success of your initiatives the various discussions and suggestions and arrive on a path ahead i am happy to be part of it warm wishes to all jim'

__label__1 b'xflowed john for future reference i think its also important to clarify for you what the dahljensen clow et al borehole results actually show see dahljensen et al past temperatures directly from the greenland ice sheet science 282 october 1998 in fact the results show that the amplitude of variability over the past 1000 years differs by a factor of 2 between the grip and dye 3 borehole estimates the latter only 865 km to the south this is an example of extreme regionalscale variability which should give pause to those who want to draw largescale inferences however even more importantly they show in the case of dye 3 the mid 20th century warm period in the record actually exceeds the medieval warm peak see fig 4 lower panel blue curve so here we have two temperature histories less than 1000 km apart in greenland which give different stories regarding the level of medieval warmth with at least one of the histories conforming precisely to the hemispheric trends presented in ipcc chapter 2 note that in the chapter we actually discuss the evidence of conflicting temperature trends in greenland though not specifically referring to dahljensen et al so do i understand correctly that you are referring to the results of dahljensen et al as conflicting with what we say in the chapter at the face of it this argument has no merit whatsoever i think we should all use a better explanation from you since you seem to be arguing publically that the dahljensen et al record undermines what weve said in the chapter thanks in advance mike ps ive ccd in eric steig a collaborator of clows and a greenland antarctic ice core expert to make sure my facts above have been presented accurately perhaps eric woudl be kind enough to forward my email to gary clow and gary can let us know directly if he disagrees with any of my remarks above'

methodology before moving ahead 5 cms will prohibit states from making certain supplemental payments to hospitals and other providers that serve medicaid managed care enrollees a move that hospitals

__label__1 b'xflowed dear martin and all others having read the new manuscript i would like to draw the attention of all of you to the section about mcintyremckitrick vs mann et al i am not entirely happy with this section it may be that i am not fully updated about all details on their dispute but it appears to be some mistakes in this section of our manuscript therefore i ask all of you to check how this section can be improved and clarified this is very important if we refer incorrectly to the mmmann dispute i am convinced that all of us will be involved in lengthy frustrating email discussions later on i anticipiate this from personal experience lets do our best to avoid this the problematic bit of text starts on p 16 para 4 the failure of mm2003 is partly due to a misunderstanding of the stepwise reconstruction method and slightly below mm2003 only calculate principal components for the period when all chronologies are present i read through the mm2003 paper yesterday from what is written there on p 763765 it appears that they were well aware of the stepwise method on p 763 about at the middle of the page they write following the description of mbh98 our construction is done piecewise for each of the periods listed in table 8 using the roster of proxies available through the period and the selection of tpcs for each period listed in table 8 this is clearly at odds to what is written in our manuscript has it been documented somewhere else that mm2003 despite what they wrote really misunderstood the stepwise technique if it is so we need to insert a reference if this is not the case we need to omit the lines about the misunderstanding we also need to explain better why the mm2003 calculations differ from mbh moreover our sentence mm2003 only calculate principal components for the period when all chronologies are present imply that mm2003 only calculated pcs for the period 18201971 as this would be the period when all chronologies are present according to the mm2003 table 8 obviously they calculated pcs beyond 1820 as their calculations actually extend back to 1400 the problem continues in the legend to our fig 2 each of the 212 data series is shown the red rectangle indicates the single block used by mm2003 neglecting all data prior to 1619 the last sentence is inconsistent with the information in mm2003 in three ways a mm2003 clearly show in their table 8 that they analysed the same blocks of data as mbh b the year 1619 as a starting point of a data block is inconsistent with mm table 8 where does the year 1619 come from it is not mentioned anywhere in mm2003 c the red block implies that mm2003 made calculations back only to 1619 but they did back to 1400 moreover the numbers given in the graph of our fig 2 indicate that the total number of series is 211 whereas the text in the legend and also in the main text on p 16 says 212 which number is correct i suppose that some of you others will know this subject much better than i i have just read the mm2003 paper and find our reference to it to be inconsistent with it i hope you all can make efforts to make this bit crystal clear if not i fear we will get problems finally i would like to draw your attention to the related sentence in our conclusions on p 26 papers which claim to refute have been reviewed and found to contain serious flaws are all of you happy with this statement would it sound better with a somewhat less offending sentence something like papers which claim to refute have been reviewed and found to essentially contribute with insignificant information that does not affect the consensus and even to include some flaws i attach the mm2003 paper i will send some comments to the other parts of the text in a separate mail cheers anders'

thomas durkins courtroom was like nothing many longtime observers had seen it had reallife pathos incredible pain old and new and the public shunning of dennis hastert former us house speaker in one room sat politicians whose paths crossed in multiple ways a victim scott cross revealed himself to be the brother of former illinois house minority leader tom cross tom cross stepped down from that post in 2013 and state rep jim durkin took over durkins brother the judge handing down the sentence meantime hastert was long known to be a mentor of tom cross among the loudest voices backing cross 2003 bid to become house minority leader in the end was 15 months enough the twitterverse and other social media blew up with complaints that hastert escaped too easily how could someone who admitted reluctantly to abusing at least five boys get 15 months yet former gov rod blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison the suntimes editorial today says hasterts sentence equates to 90 days for each boy hastert abused in court durkin explained that if hastert had been charged with child molestation hed face a far steeper sentence but that statute had run and durkin repeatedly made clear that at least part of hasterts punishment was losing his good name that much is true about that statute illinois attorney general lisa madigan announced she would work with the illinois coalition against sexual assault to remove the current statute of limitations for sexual assault crimes against children illinois law should allow children who have been victims of sexual assault and abuse the time to come forward and report their crimes survivors of sexual assault crimes during their childhood should be afforded the time it takes to process their assault and come forward to report their crimes to authorities madigan said in a statement there was so much hastert news this morning we boiled down some of the highlights for readers lets begin with this question were there more victims from our story in politico in a recent phone interview scott cross told politico he personally knew there were more accusers i can tell you there are nine victims not five he said i know ive confirmed there are nine on hastert cross said he has his bed to lie in his time will come the makers got his number link the sentencing hearing suntimes lead broken guilty and struggling to stand before a federal judge the man once called mr speaker just couldnt say the words so us district judge thomas durkin finally put him in a corner wednesday forcing a quibbling and reluctant dennis hastert to clearly

link tribune lead in his 2004 memoir former us house speaker dennis hastert claimed he was never a good liar maybe i wasnt smart enough hastert wrote i could never get away with it so i made up my

dennis hastert the republican who for eight years presided over the house and was second in the line of succession to the presidency was sentenced wednesday to more than a year in prison in a

rush to get hastert sentence all wrong by robert feder in the rush to be first they got it wrong way wrong well before judge thomas m durkin handed down a 15month prison sentence to dennis hastert multiple chicago media outlets broadcast and posted inaccurate reports wednesday that the former us house speaker would serve no jail time the error apparently occurred when some reporters misunderstood durkins reference early in his remarks to two years of supervised release for hastert after his prison term for paying hush money to cover up sexual abuse from decades ago several television stations seemed initially confused but none compounded the mistake as aggressively as wgnchannel 9 for close to an hour the tribune media stations midday news anchors steve sanders and dina bair discussed dissected and disparaged the no jail time angle with instudio news analyst paul lisnek an attorney lisnek repeatedly called it the luckiest day of hasterts life for avoiding prison link

dennis hastert caught a break he did not deserve federal judge thomas m durkin on monday sentenced hastert once among the most powerful elected officials in the nation to a mere 90 days in prison if you do the math for each of the five boys he is alleged to have sexually abused durkin could have sent hastert away for as long as five years for the technical banking crimes to which he had pleaded

and so is every punishment hastert may outlive his 15month incarceration if thats what he ends up serving durkin said he wasnt intending to deliver a death sentence the enduring impact is that the

the embarrassment and added pain of going public he was under no legal compulsion to come forward to disclose what he had long considered his darkest secret instead he forthrightly told how hastert

court after months of angst about whether to come forward by chicago tribunes christy gutowski jason meisner and jeff coen in the months that followed the scandalous federal indictment of his famous high school wrestling coach scott cross has struggled through sleepless nights with anger guilt shame and fear he wondered if coming forward publicly to say dennis hastert molested him nearly four decades ago when cross was a yorkville high school senior would make a difference would it encourage other survivors of childhood sexual abuse to find their voice would speaking out persuade the judge

mckinney illinois stripped former us house of representatives speaker dennis hastert of his teachers pension on wednesday but his sentencing for a federal financial crime linked to past sex abuse will not cost him a second more lucrative 28025 annual pension from his six years as a member of the illinois house of representatives because the crime to which hastert admitted happened more than two

__label__1 b'by ben white 05112016 0800 am edt more on trumps debt comments from a top financial services executive it doesnt make sense to buy back debt at lower prices because you would have to borrow money to do it and you would be paying higher rates on that money there would be no economic gain in making such a move the whole thing is so absurd if you are running annual deficits like we are you wouldnt be adding any economic value and we borrow every single day the moment we give anyone the idea that we would not pay it back one hundred percent they would stop lending to us or they would charge us a lot more per a former senior treasury official i think trump may have finally figured out how to pay for the wall mexico will build it to keep out americans fleeing the effects of the trump default mohamed a elerian on bloomberg view given the other ailments of the postrecession economy it isnt easy to argue that a sharp reduction in the national debt should be an immediate standalone and overwhelming priority and it does not belong among the top three upfront economic goals of the next administration although the longerterm trajectory of debt should be kept under close scrutiny and contained there is no evidence that the uss existing stock of federal debt is a major problem borrowing costs are extremely low the us has access to abundant financing and unlike many

spending resources and political capital so late in the process clinton is still on track to pass the threshold to clinch the nomination at some point in june using a combination of pledged delegates and superdelegates and her lead among pledged delegates remains above 275 that makes it extremely difficult for sanders to catch up to her unless he can win over a large number of the party elites who

__label__1 b'hi everyone let me say that i dont mind what you put in the policy makers summary if there is a general concensus however some general discussion would be valuable first like phil i think that the supposed separation of the treering reconstruction from the others on the grounds that it is not a true multiproxy series is hard to justify what is true is that these particular treering data best represent summer temperatures mostly at the northern boreal forest regions by virtue of this they also definately share significant variance with northern hemisphere land and land and marine annual temperatures but at decadal and multidecadal timescales simply by virtue of the fact that these series correlated with the former at these timescales the multi proxy series mann et al jones et al supposedly represent annual and summer seasons respectively and both contain large proportions of treering input the latest treering density curve ie our data that have been processed to retain low frequency information shows more similarity to the other two series as do a number of other lower resolution data bradley et al peck et al and new crowley series see our recent science piece whether this represents truth however is a difficult problem i know mike thinks his series is the best and he might be right but he may also be too dismissive of other data and possibly over confident in his or should i say his use of others after all the early preinstrumental data are much less reliable as indicators of global temperature than is apparent in modern calibrations that include them and when we dont know the precise role of particular proxies in the earlier portions of reconstruction it remains problematic to assign genuine confidence limits at multidecadal and longer timescales i still contend that multiple regression against the recent very trendy global mean series is potentially dangerous you could calibrate the proxies to any number of seasons regardless of their true optimum response not for a moment am i saying that the treering or any other proxy data are better than mikes series indeed i am saying that the various reconstructions are not independent but that they likely contribute more information about reality together than they do alone i do believe that it should not be taken as read that mikes series or jones et al for that matter is the correct one i prefer a figure that shows a multitude of reconstructions eg similar to that in my science piece incidently arguing that any particular series is probably better on the basis of what we now about glaciers or solar output is flaky indeed glacier mass balance is driven by the difference mainly in winter accumulation and summer ablation filtered in a complex nonlinear way to give variously lagged tongue advanceretreat simple inference on the precidence of modern day snout positions does not translate easily into absolute or relative temperature levels now or in the past similarly i dont see that we are able to substantiate the veracity of different temperature reconstructions through reference to solar forcing theories without making assumptions on the effectiveness of seasonally specific longterm insolation changes in different parts of the globe and the contribution of solar forcing to the observed 20th century warming there is still a potential problem with nonlinear responses in the very recent period of some biological proxies or perhaps a fertilisation through high co2 or nitrate input i know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data but in reality the situation is not quite so simple we dont have a lot of proxies that come right up to date and those that do at least a significant number of tree proxies some unexpected changes in response that do not match the recent warming i do not think it wise that this issue be ignored in the chapter for the record i do believe that the proxy data do show unusually warm conditions in recent decades i am not sure that this unusual warming is so clear in the summer responsive data i believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1000 years ago i do not believe that global mean annual temperatures have simply cooled progressively over thousands of years as mike appears to and i contend that that there is strong evidence for major changes in climate over the holocene not milankovich that require explanation and that could represent part of the current or future background variability of our climate i think the venice meeting will be a good place to air these isssues finally i appologise for this rather selfindulgent ramble but i thought i may as well voice these points to you i too would be happy to go through the recent draft of the chapter when it becomes available cheers to all keith'

xueamailscanner found to be clean phil fyi thank you for sharing your paper i have circulated the attached to our ccsp committee with the permission of eugenia and ming and want to also share with you the conclusion from my own work with the ncep reanalysis is that it is appropriate for trend assessments if integrated metrics are used thickness for example and for regions where the regional trend signal is quite large we have published on both of this issues one valueadded of reanalyses is that since the winds are monitored independently of the temperatures they provide information on the horizontal layer averaged temperatures in the mid and highlatitudes which helps adjust to some extent biases in the temperatures also as we have shown with regional data eg florida and others have shown elsewhere eg andy pitman for australia there is a clear land use change signal on surface temperature this provides independent evidence that the kalnay and cai results should be expected roger

debate of course should really take place in the literature there has been however in my view an unfortunate change over time where reviewers who disagree with already published work recommend rejection of subsequent work rather than letting the community view and assess the different perspectives on a science issue our report has to make sure it is inclusive in order to avoid this pitfall an unbiased discussion of the kc results and ways to resolve the disagreement through hypothesis testing should be included in the appropriate chapters roger roger a pielke sr professor and state

dear roger attached is the preliminary summary report on our recent work on the estimate of landusechange climate impact using the reanalysis very fortunately we had secured a oneyear funding from nsf starting last august despite a short time period we have already produced sufficient results to confirm the robustness of our original work using different datasets that have the stateofart quality here i just want to add one more comment about simmons et al paper basically they claimed that the difference between the era40 and cru is very small and therefore our method is not applicable if the reanalysis is as good as the era40 there are two things that are incorrect in their claims first of all if the reanalysis were made to be exactly the same as the observations by definition there would be no difference between reanalysis and the surface observations since the era40 was obtained by directly assimilating the cru surface observations whereas the nnr didnt use any surface temp observation it is natural to expect that the difference between the surface observation and era40 is small second simmons et al manually reduces the difference between the era40 and cru by setting the mean difference between the era40 and cru from 1987 to 2001 be zero as a result the difference looks very small in recent years however the difference from 1961 to 1985 has to be larger otherwise they would make an error in their plot in other words by doing so the gap between the era40 and cru appears decreasing in time rather increasing in time as shown in kc and in the new figure 1 in the attached file which is the same as simmons et al paper except we reset the 196070 to be zero in order to see how the positive gap increases in time if we closely examine their figures we will see by applying their treatment the gap between cru and reanalysis is a negative one eg cru is below era40 from 1960 to 1980 and such a negative gap decrease in time is equivalent to that the positive gap increases in time as found in kc from the nnr data eg the cru becomes more above the era40 so simmons et als results actually confirm our findings rather discredit our finding we actually reproduced simmons et al calculations and confirm that their results are correct see the second attached figure which is identical to fig1 in our preliminary report except the negative gap is used and 1year running mean was applied as in simmons et al but their interpretations are incorrect i appreciate if you could also forward the email to the ccsp authors let me know if you want to me to reply to tom and ccsp coauthors directly regards ming the report the replica of one of the key figures in simmons et al'

on ice the wall street journal 18 february 2005 1linksb110869271828758608idjeonmlah4n5yta4ghaqyim4 00html on wednesday national hockey league commissioner gary bettman canceled the season and we guess thats a loss but this week also brought news of something else thats been put on ice were talking about the hockey stick just so were clear this hockey stick isnt a sports implement its a scientific graph back in the late 1990s american geoscientist michael mann published a chart that purported to show average surface temperatures in the northern hemisphere over the past 1000 years the chart showed relatively minor fluctuations in temperature over the first 900 years then a sharp and continuous rise over the past century giving it a hockeystick shape mr manns chart was both a scientific and political sensation it contradicted a body of scientific work suggesting a warm period early in the second millennium followed by a little ice age starting in the 14th century it also provided some visually arresting scientific support for the contention that fossilfuel emissions were the cause of higher temperatures little wonder then that mr manns hockey stick appears five times in the intergovernmental panel on climate changes landmark 2001 report on global warming which paved the way to this weeks global ratification sans the us australia and china of the kyoto protocol yet there were doubts about mr manns methods and analysis from the start in 1998 willie soon and sallie baliunas of the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics published a paper in the journal climate research arguing that there really had been a medieval warm period the result messrs soon and baliunas were treated as heretics and six editors at climate research were made to resign still questions persisted in 2003 stephen mcintyre a toronto minerals consultant and amateur mathematician and ross mckitrick an economist at canadas university of guelph jointly published a critique of the hockey stick analysis their conclusion mr manns work was riddled with collation errors unjustifiable truncations of extrapolation of source data obsolete data geographical location errors incorrect calculations of principal components and other quality control defects once these were corrected the medieval warm period showed up again in the data this should have produced a healthy scientific debate instead as the journals antonio regalado reported monday mr mann tried to shut down debate by refusing to disclose the mathematical algorithm by which he arrived at his conclusions all the same mr mann was forced to publish a retraction of some of his initial data and doubts about his statistical methods have since grown statistician francis zwiers of environment canada a government agency notes that mr manns method preferentially produces hockey sticks when there are none in the data other reputable scientists such as berkeleys richard muller and hans von storch of germanys gkss center essentially agree we realize this may all seem like so much academic nonsense yet if there really was a medieval warm period we draw no conclusions it would cast some doubt on the contention that our suvs and air conditioners rather than natural causes are to blame for apparent global warming there is also the notsosmall matter of the politicization of science if climate scientists feel their careers might be put at risk by questioning some orthodoxy the inevitable result will be bad science it says something that it took two nonclimate scientists to bring mr manns errors to light but the important point is this the world is being lobbied to place a huge economic bet as much as 150 billion a year on the notion that manmade global warming is real businesses are gearing up at considerable cost to deal with a new regulatory environment complex carbontrading schemes are in the making shouldnt everyone look very carefully and honestly at the science before we jump off this particular cliff copyright 2005 the wall street journal 2 science and open algorithms you can prove anything with secret data and algorithms jerry pournell 18 february 2005 2linkhockeystick science and open algorithms you can prove anything with secret data and algorithms there is a long piece on the global hockey stick in todays wall street journal that explains something i didnt understand mann who generated the hockey stick curve purporting to show that the last century was unique in all recorded history with its sharp climb in temperature has released neither the algorithm that generated his curve nor the data on which it was based i had refrained from commenting on the hockey stick because i couldnt understand how it was derived ive done statistical analysis and prediction from uncertainty much of my life my first job in aerospace was as part of the human factors and reliability group at boeing where we were expected to deal with such matters as predicting component failures and deriving maintenance schedules replace it before it fails but not so long before it fails that the costs including the cost of the maintenance crew and the costs of taking the airplane out of service are prohibitive and other such matters i used to live with incomplete gamma functions and other complex integrals and i could not for the life of me understand how mann derived his famous curve now i know he hasnt told anyone he says that telling people how he generated it would be tantamount to giving in to his critics more on this after my walk but the one thing we may conclude for sure is that this is not science his curve has been distributed as part of the canadian governments literature on why canada supports kyoto and is said to have been influential in causing the kyoto consensus so it is certainly effective propaganda but it is not science science deals with repeatability and openness when i took philosophy of science from gustav bergmann at the university of iowa a very long time ago our seminar came to a onesentence practical definition of science science is what you can put in a letter to a colleague and hell get the same results you did now i dont claim that as original for it wasnt even me who came up with it in the seminar but i do claim bergmann liked that formulation and it certainly appealed to me and i havent seen a better onesentence practical definition of science manns work doesnt meet that definition and those who use manns curve in their arguments are not making a scientific argument one of pournelles laws states you can prove anything if you can make up your data i will now add another pournelles law you can prove anything if you can keep your algorithms secret 3 open season on hockey and peer review science policy 18 february 2005 3link nonhockehtml by kevin vranes the recent 214 wsj article global warring by antonio regaldo addresses the debate that most readers of this site are well familiar with the mann et al hockey stick the wsj is still asking and trying to answer the basic questions hockey stick or no hockey stick but the background premise of the article stated explicitly and implicitly throughout is that it was the hockey stick that led to kyoto and other climate policy is it i think its fair to say that to all of us in the field of climatology the notion that kyoto is based on the mann curve is utter nonsense if a climatologist or a policy advisor charged with knowing the science well enough to make astute recommendations to hisher boss relied solely on the mann curve to prove definitively the existence of anthropogenic warming then were in deeper trouble than anybody realizes this is essentially what stephan ramstorf writes in a 127 realclimate post and although its easy to believe that national and international policy can hinge on single graphs i hope we give policy makers more credit than that but maybe we are in that much trouble the wsj highlights what regaldo and mcintyre says is manns resistance or outright refusal to provide to inquiring minds his data all details of his statistical analysis and his code the wsjs anecdotal treatment of the subject goes toward confirming what ive been hearing for years in climatology circles about not just mann but others collecting original climate data as concerns mann himself this is especially curious in light of the recent realclimate posts link and link in which mann and gavin schmidt warn us about peer review and the limits therein their point is essentially that peer review is limited and can be much less than thorough one assumes that they are talking about their own work as well as mcintyres although they never state this mann and schmidt go to great lengths in their post to single out geophysical research letters their post then seems a bit ironic as grl is the journal in which the original mann curve was published 1999 vol 26 issue 6 p 759 an article which is now receiving much attention as being flawed and underreviewed for that matter why does table 1 in mann et al 1999 list many chronologies in the southern hemisphere while the rest of the paper promotes a northern hemisphere reconstruction legit or not its a confusing aspect of the paper that should never have made it past peer review of their take on peer review i couldnt agree more in my experience peer review is often cursory at best so this is what i say to dr mann and others expressing deep concern over peer review give up your data methods and code freely and with a smile on your face that is real peer review a 12 yearold hacker prodigy in her grandparents basement should have as much opportunity to check your work as a semiretired toronto minerals consultant those without three letters after their name can be every bit as intellectually qualified and will likely have the time for careful review that typical academic reviewers find lacking specious analysis of your work will be borne out by your colleagues and will enter the debate with every other original work your job is not to prevent your critics from checking your work and potentially distorting it your job is to continue to publish insightful detailed analyses of the data and let the community decide you can be part of the debate without seeming to hinder access to it 4 climate change science time for team b the american enterprise institute 15 february 2005 4link by steven f hayward the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is currently working on its fourth assessment report despite the ipccs noble intent to generate a scientific consensus a number of factors have compromised the research and drafting process assuring that its next assessment report will be just as controversial as previous reports in 1995 and 2001 efforts to reform this large bureaucratic effort are unlikely to succeed perhaps the time has come to consider competition as the means of checking the ipccs monopoly and generating more reliable climate science as the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc moves toward the release of its fourth assessment report fourth ar in 2007 the case of chris landsea offers in microcosm an example of why the ipccs findings are going to have credibility problems last month landsea a climate change scientist with the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa resigned as a participant in the producing the report landsea had been a chapter author and reviewer for the ipccs second assessment report in 1995 and the third in 2001 and he is a leading expert on hurricanes and related extreme weather phenomena he had signed on with the ipcc to update the state of current knowledge on atlantic hurricanes for the fourth report in an open letter landsea wrote that he could no longer in good conscience participate in a process that is being motivated by preconceived agendas and is scientifically unsound1 landseas resignation was prompted by an all too familiar occurrence the lead author of the fourth ars chapter on climate observations kevin trenberth participated in a press conference that warned of increasing hurricane activity as a result of global warming2 it is common to hear that manmade global warming represents the consensus of science yet the use of hurricanes and cyclones as a marker of global warming represents a clearcut case of the consensus being roundly ignored both the second and third ipcc assessments concluded that there was no global warming signal found in the hurricane record moreover most climate models predict future warming will have only a small effectif anyon hurricane strength it is beyond me landsea wrote why my colleagues would utilize the media to push an unsupported agenda that recent hurricane activity has been due to global warming3 landseas critique goes beyond a fit of pique at the abuse of his area of expertise the ipcc he believes has become thoroughly politicized and is unresponsive to criticism when i have raised my concerns to the ipcc leadership landsea wrote their response was simply to dismiss my concerns4 landseas frustration is not an isolated experience mit physicist richard lindzen another past ipcc author who is not participating in the fourth report has written my experiences over the past 16 years have led me to the discouraging conclusion that we are dealing with the almost insoluble interaction of an iron triangle with an iron rice bowl lindzens iron triangle consists of activists misusing science to get the attention of the news media and politicians the iron rice bowl is the parallel phenomenon where scientists exploit the activists alarm to increase research funding and attention for the issue5 and dr john zillman one of australias leading climate scientists is another exipcc participant who believes the ipcc has become cast more in the model of supporting than informing policy development6 and when the ipcc is not ignoring its responsible critics like landsea and lindzen it is demonizing them not long ago the ipccs chairman dr rajendra pachauri compared ecoskeptic bjorn lomborg to hitler what is the difference between lomborgs view of humanity and hitlers pachauri asked in a danish newspaper if you were to accept lomborgs way of thinking then maybe what hitler did was the right thing7 lomborgs sin was merely to follow the consensus practice of economists in applying a discount to present costs for future benefits and comparing the range of outcomes with other world problems alongside climate change it is hard to judge what is worse pachauris appalling judgment in resorting to reductio ad hitlerum or his abysmal ignorance of basic economics in either case it is hard to have much confidence in the policy advice the ipcc might have time for team b the time has come to question the ipccs status as the nearmonopoly source of information and advice for its member governments it is probably futile to propose reform of the present ipcc process like most bureaucracies it has too much momentum and its institutional interests are too strong for anyone realistically to suppose that it can assimilate more diverse points of view even if more scientists and economists were keen to join up the rectitude and credibility of the ipcc could be best improved not through reform but through competition full paper at 5link 5 bring the proxies up to date climate audit 20 february 2005 6linkmore89 steve mcintyre i will make here a very simple suggestion if ipcc or others want to use multiproxy reconstructions of world temperature for policy purposes stop using data ending in 1980 and bring the proxies uptodate lets see how they perform in the warm 1990s which should be an ideal period to show the merit of the proxies i do not believe that any responsible policymaker can base policy even in part on the continued use of obsolete data ending in 1980 when the costs of bringing the data uptodate is inconsequential compared to kyoto costs i would appreciate comments on this note as i think that i will pursue the matter with policymakers for example in manns famous hockey stick graph as presented to policymakers and to the public the graph used manns reconstruction from proxies up to 1980 and instrumental temperatures here as in other similar studies using jones more lurid cru surface history rather than the more moderate increases shown by satellite measurements usually but not always a different color is used for the instrumental portion but from a promotional point of view the juxtaposition of the two series achieves the desired promotional effect in mining promotions where there is considerable community experience with promotional graphics and statistics securities commission prohibit the adding together of proven ore reserves and inferred ore reserves a policy which deserves a little reflection in the context of ipcc studies last week a brand new multiproxy study by european scientists moberg et al 2005 was published in nature on the very day of publication i received an email from a prominent scientist telling me that manns hockeystick was yesterdays news that the community had now moved on and so should i that the community had had no opportunity to verify mobergs results however meritorious they may finally appear seemed to matter not at all if you look at the proxy portion of the new moberg graphic you see nothing that would be problematic for opponents of the hockey stick it shows a striking medieval warm period mwp a cold little ice age and 20th century warming not quite reaching mwp levels by 1979 when the proxy portion of the study ends im in the process of examining the individual proxies and the moberg reconstruction is not without its own imperfections in the presentation to the public see the figure in the nature article itself once again there is the infamous splice between reconstruction by proxy up to 1980 and the instrumental record thereafter once again jones cru record rather than the satellite record one of the first question that occurs to any civilian becoming familiar with these studies and it was one of my first questions is what happens to the proxies after 1980 given the presumed warmth of the 1990s and especially 1998 the warmest year in the millennium youd think that the proxy values would be off the chart in effect the last 25 years have provided an ideal opportunity to validate the usefulness of proxies and especially the opportunity to test the confidence intervals of these studies put forward with such assurance by the multiproxy proponents what happens to the proxies used in mbh99 or moberg et al 2005 or crowley and lowery 2000 in the 1990s and especially 1998 this question about proxies after 1980 was posed by a civilian to mann in december at realclimate mann replied most reconstructions only extend through about 1980 because the vast majority of treering coral and ice core records currently available in the public domain do not extend into the most recent decades while paleoclimatologists are attempting to update many important proxy records to the present this is a costly and laborintensive activity often requiring expensive field campaigns that involve traveling with heavy equipment to difficulttoreach locations such as highelevation or remote polar sites for historical reasons many of the important records were obtained in the 1970s and 1980s and have yet to be updated my bold pause and think about this response think about the costs of kyoto and then think again about this answer think about the billions spent on climate research and then try to explain to me why we need to rely on important records obtained in the 1970s far more money has been spent on climate research in the last decade than in the 1970s why are we still relying on obsolete proxy data as someone with actual experience in the mineral exploration business which also involves expensive field campaigns that involve traveling with heavy equipment to difficulttoreach locations i can assure readers that manns response cannot be justified and is an embarrassment to the paleoclimate community the more that i think about it the more outrageous is both the comment itself and the fact that no one seems to have picked up on it it is even more outrageous when you look in detail at what is actually involved in collecting the proxy data used in the medieval period in the key multiproxy studies the number of proxies used in mbh99 is from fewer than 40 sites 28 tree ring sites being us tree ring sites represented in 3 principal component series as to the time needed to update some of these tree ring sites here is an excerpt from lamarche et al 1984 on the collection of key tree ring cores from sheep mountain and campito mountain which are the most important indicators in the mbh reconstruction dag graybill and mrr rose collected tree ring samples at 3325 m on mount jefferson toquima range nevada and 11 august 1981 dag and mrr collected samples from 13 trees at campito mountain 3400 m and from 15 trees at sheep mountain 3500 m on 31 october 1983 now to get to campito mountain and sheep mountain they had to get to bishop california which is hardly remote even by paris hilton standards and then proceed by road to within a few hundred meters of the site perhaps proceeding for some portion of the journey on unpaved roads the picture below illustrates the taking of a tree ring core while the equipment may seem heavy to someone used only to desk work using computers people in the mineral exploration business would not regard this drill as being especially heavy and i believe that people capable of operating such heavy equipment can be found even in outofthe way places like bishop california i apologize for the tone here but it is impossible for me not to be facetious there is only one relatively remote site in the entire mbh99 roster the quelccaya glacier in peru here fortunately the work is already done although needless to say it is not published this information was updated in 2003 by lonnie thompson and should be adequate to update these series with sufficient pressure from the us national science foundation the data should be available expeditiously given that thompson has not archived data from dunde drilled in 1987 the need for pressure should not be underestimated i realize that the rings need to be measured and that the field work is only a portion of the effort involved but updating 28 tree ring sites in the united states is not a monumental enterprise nor would updating any of the other sites ive looked through lists of the proxies used in jones et al 1998 mbh99 crowley and lowery 2000 mann and jones 2003 moberg et al 2005 and see no obstacles to bringing all these proxies up to date the only sites that might take a little extra time would be updating the himalayan ice cores even here its possible that taking very short cores or even pits would prove adequate for an update and this might prove easier than one might be think be that as it may any delays in updating the most complicated location should not deter updating all the other locations as far as im concerned this should be the first order of business for multiproxy studies whose responsibility is this while the costs are trivial in the scheme of kyoto they would still be a significant line item in the budget of a university department i think that the responsibility here lies with the us national science foundation and its equivalents in canada and europe the responsibilities for collecting the proxy updates could be divided up in a couple of emails and budgets established one other important aspect right now the funding agencies fund academics to do the work and are completely ineffective in ensuring prompt reporting at best academic practice will tie up reporting of results until the publication of articles in an academic journals creating a delay right at the start even then in cases like thompson or jacoby to whom ive referred elsewhere the data may never be archived or only after decades in the hands of the originator so here i would propose something more like what happens in a mineral exploration program when a company has drill results it has to publish them through a press release it cant wait for academic reports or for its geologists to spin the results theres lots of time to spin afterwards good or bad the results have to be made public the company has a little discretion so that it can release drill holes in bunches and not every single drill hole but the discretion cant build up too much during an important program here i would insist that the proxy results be archived as soon as they are produced the academic reports and spin can come later since all these sites have already been published people are used to the proxies and the updates will to a considerable extend speak for themselves what would i expect from such studies drill programs are usually a surprise and maybe theres one here my hunch is that the classic proxies will not show anywhere near as loud a signal in the 1990s as is needed to make statements comparing the 1990s to the medieval warm period with any confidence at all ive not surveyed proxies in the 1990s nor to my knowledge has anyone else but ive started to look and many do not show the expected loud signal eg some of the proxies posted up on this site such as alaskan tree rings tthh ring widths and theories are starting to develop but the discussions so far do not explicit point out the effect of signal failure on the multiproxy reconstruction project but this is only a hunch and the evidence could be otherwise the point is this theres no need to speculate any further its time to bring the classic proxies up to date 6 careless science costs lives the guardian 18 february 2005 7link3604141722400html dick taverne in science as in much of life it is believed that you get what you pay for according to opinion polls people do not trust scientists who work for industry because they only care about profits or government scientists because they suspect them of trying to cover up the truth scientists who work for environmental ngos are more highly regarded because they are trying to save the planet people are ready to believe that what they say must be true a house of lords report science and society published in 2000 agreed that motives matter it argued that science and scientists are not valuefree and therefore that scientists would command more trust if they openly declare the values that underpin their work it all sounds very plausible but mostly it is wrong scientists with the best of motives can produce bad science just as scientists whose motives may be considered suspect can produce good science an obvious example of the first was rachel carson who if not the patron saint was at least the founding mother of modern environmentalism her book the silent spring was an inspiring account of the damage caused to our natural environment by the reckless spraying of pesticides especially ddt however carson also claimed that ddt caused cancer and liver damage claims for which there is no evidence but which led to an effective worldwide ban on the use of ddt that is proving disastrous her motives were pure the science was wrong ddt is the most effective agent ever invented for preventing insectborne disease which according to the us national academy of sciences and the who prevented over 50 million human deaths from malaria in about two decades although there is no evidence that ddt harms human health some ngos still demand a worldwide ban for that reason careless science cost lives contrast the benefits that have resulted from the profit motive a motive that is held to be suspect by the public multinationals chief villains in the demonology of contemporary anticapitalists have developed antibiotics vaccines that have eradicated many diseases like smallpox and polio genetically modified insulin for diabetics and plants such as gm insectresistant cotton that have reduced the need for pesticides and so increased the income and improved the health of millions of small cotton farmers the fact is that selfinterest can benefit the public as effectively as philanthropy motives are not irrelevant and unselfish motives are rightly admired more than selfish ones there are numerous examples of misconduct by big companies and we should examine their claims critically and provide effective regulation to control abuses of power and ensure the safety of their products equally we should not uncritically accept the claims of those who act from idealistic motives ngos inspired by the noble cause of protecting our environment often become careless about evidence and exaggerate risks to attract attention and funds although every leading scientific academy has concluded that gm crops are at least as safe as conventional foods this does not stop greenpeace reiterating claims about the dangers of frankenfoods stephen schneider a climatologist publicly justified distortion of evidence because we are not just scientists but human beings as well we need to capture the public imagination so we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we have but in the end motives are irrelevant to the validity of science it does not matter if a scientist wants to help mankind get a new grant win a nobel prize or increase the profits of her company it does not matter whether a researcher works for monsanto or for greenpeace results are no more to be trusted if the researcher declares his values and confesses that he beats his wife believes in god or is an arsenal supporter what matters is that the work has been peerreviewed that the findings are reproducible and that they last if they do they are good science if not not science itself is valuefree there are objective truths in science we can now regard it as a fact that the earth goes rounds the sun and that darwinism explains the evolution of species a look at the history of science makes it evident how irrelevant the values of scientists are newtons passion for alchemy did not invalidate his discovery of the laws of gravitation to quote professor fox of rutgers university how was it relevant to mendels findings about peas that he was a white european monk they would have been just as valid if mendel had been a spanishspeaking lesbian atheist lord taverne is chair of sense about science and

interesting article on the possible breakup of nea 2004 mn4 in the year 2029 but theres another reason for concern according to dan durda another swri astronomer 2004 mn4 is likely to be a rubblepile asteroid consisting of material only loosely held together by gravity because the asteroid will pass us at just 25 times earths diameter tidal forces could tear it apart the result would be a trail of rocks drifting slowly apart with the passage of time one or more of these might hit earth in the more distant future creating a spectacular fireball as it burns up in the atmosphere bill cooke astronomy magazine 10 february 2005 first of all a 300m asteroid could break into 100 pieces each larger than the tunguska impactor secondly the years for which a ts rating of 1 already exist for the object are not in the distant future but 6 7 and 8 years later that reminds us that neither the torino nor the palermo scale takes into account the possibility of such a mirved approach furthermore the palermo scale is designed to take into account the lead time even if 2004 mn4 were not to break up the lead time to virtual impact in 2029 would be down to one sixth of the time today in other words if the post2029 orbit is not being resolved before then we may as well up the ps rating accordingly if my math is correct we should add 078 to its palermo scale rating ie log106 for a total of 065 yours sincerely jens kiefferolsen msceleceng slagelse denmark 9 and finally europe further falling behind in technology and research eu observer 10 february 2005 8link by lucia kubosova brussels euobserver europeans are still failing to show world leadership in technology and research a new report shows the paper published on thursday 10 february has evaluated the eu research and development programmes and their impact on europes knowledgebase and potential for innovation while it argues that eu funds for the programmes make a major contribution it suggests that more resources industry participation and simplified administration are needed for them to have a greater effect in future we have somehow lost momentum said erkki ormala chair of the panel issuing the report the eu is falling behind and we are now under pressue not only compared to our traditional rivals like the us or japan but also china india or brazil we are facing a much tougher competition in talent and knowledge than we are used to research commissioner janez potocnik considers the papers results as a reason for doubling the funds in his portfolio within the next budgetary period of 20072013 we dont want to achieve our economic growth by lowering the social or environmental standards so to compete globally we need to focus on knowledge mr potocnik said to journalists adding that the eu programmes should make a bridge between practical innovation and research the report has listed several possible solutions for tackling outlined setbacks it argues that the eu must attract and reward the best talent mobilise resources for innovation and boost cooperation between governments businesses and universities in research it supports the idea of setting up a european research council to promote excellence and encourages more industry involvement mainly on the part of small and mediumsized enterprises smes however sme representatives complain that their ideas about eu research and innovation funding are not taken into consideration its not about how big the budget is for smes and their involvement in such projects it is rather about the allocation of the funds most of them are granted for huge longterm projects which cost millions of euro and they can hardly attract smaller companies according to ullrich schroeder from ueapme the main umbrella organisation he argues that while several reports have already pointed out that smes must be more involved if the lisbon agenda goal of 3 percent of gdp to be invested in research and development in the eu by 2010 is to be achieved in reality they are not as well supported as huge transnational companies it is not that the eu member states invest much less in universities than the us but the greatest difference is that european smes are only investing 8 of the us amount and it is simply not enough mr schroeder also said that while there is a lot of rhetoric from politicians that the smes should get involved innovate and compete when they come up with good projects they are not sufficiently supported the european commission is more concerned about big companies and hightech areas while innovation is needed also in more downto

__label__1 b'phil thanks for this great detail i am thinking that probably a raw radiosonde dataset may be better i tried this before using the lks dataset but station density was an issue and only ended up with around 20 station pairs it sounds as though things have improved dramatically in that area and will look at the sources you suggest my hope is that at least i can find hundredsthousands of stations near to my high elevation surface ones for comparison if not i could interpolate spatially maybe between radiosondes to my surface sites since freeair climate not meteorology should be relatively smooth in space i cannot interpolate between surface stations i agree that reanalyses can be a can of worms esp ncepncar as for the surface ill also look at the site you suggest and get back if i have any qproblems i appreciate the time you have taken to answer some of my q best wishes nick nick i dont want to put off but there is an awful lot of things wrong with ncepncar they are probably ok for monthtomonth variability but if you look at some of the figures in simmons et al 2004 youll see that for trends they are practically useless before 1979 there is just so much wrong with the sondes which together with the introduction of satellite data in 19789 makes reanalyses awful the simmons paper is about how much better era40 is than ncepncar it is also telling you that you shouldnt be using ncepncar for trends and era40 is only ok in europe and north america a group of us are hopeful of getting an eu project funded to go through the reanalysis input surface and sonde the aim is to put in all the homogenised surface and sonde data so giving reanalysis better data input and putting back all the data that missed the realtime cut im not sure youre aware that no back data have ever got into the reanalyses if data doesnt make the cut in real time it can never get in later the reanalysis source input doesnt collect back data youd be better off getting one of the newer sonde datasets hadat2 although developed in 2005 is beyond its sellby date have a look at the attached and this web site link raob core version 14 is the latest the drop off in surface data isnt the fault of ghcnv2 the folks in asheville are doing all they can to get additional datasets currently about 2000 sites are exchanged in real time if the sites you want are not exchanged by met services in real time we cant get access to them except by asking each met service andor waiting till the next volumes of the 10year books for 20012010 get released crutem3 has some additional station data going in for australia and canada but apart from this we will have nothing more than ghcnv2 we could get a load more from the us quite easily but coverage is reasonable there compared to the rest of the world ghcnv2 and ourselves have lots of historic series but these arent updatable in real time without continuous effort lots of projects were funded in the us and europe in the 1980s and 1990s to get loads of data digitized homogenized and accessible it is possible to do things with daily data synops but these are only generally good enough for the good countries link this site has what is available in real time since 2001 this site can be very annoying there is a link back to ncdc cheers phil cheers phil'

__label__1 b'mike i am off to finland for a week but i am sending you via tim a copy of a draft perspectives piece for science on you recent 1000year reconstruction paper they want to run it in early may i think and i have been told i will see their edited draft on my return the idea was to make a wider comment that just report on your latest curve so i decided to mention uncertainties in treering data while pushing the need for more work on highresolution proxies and especially interpretive work in the very recent context of high temperatures and other possible anthropogenic environmental disturbance the trouble is that they would only give us 1000 words and one figure anyway this figure now contains a selection of various largescale temperature average series all recalibrated against northern warm season aprilsept average land data north of 20 degrees north this is just to provide a convenient common scale all the original season area references are given you will see that this brings phils curve nicely back in line and the correct low frequency density curve now fits better also i have taken the opportunity to put our new longish 2000yeartreering width curve in representing the north of europesiberia this is the average of tornetrasksweden and yamal and taimyrsiberia all processed to retain lowfrequency variance these curves and a similar average incorporating all the northern treering data not including the large density set are in my paper for the pages open science meeting publication tim and i will produce a short paper describing the new lowfrequency density curve probably for geophysical research letters for the meantime i hope you think the perspectives piece is ok let me know if you have any problems with it but remember that they are going to hack it about anyway by the way how did you compare the highelevation pc1 timeseries with jacoby and darrigos northern treeline data in your paper when the latter only go back to 1671 did you use their reworked giddings dataset for alaska thanks for the message on the ipcc stuff i am happy to write any additional bits or make suggestions sorry i did not get back to you last time but i was confused about the timetable thanks for putting my name on the list i will make comments again as soon as i see the next draft cheers keith'

things appear to be moving swiftly in the senate armed services committees closed markup of the national defense authorization act with work expected to wrap up by early afternoon senate armed services chairman john mccain rariz told morning d wednesday evening everything is fine so far other senators on the panel also said they were confident the markup would wrap today the committee has blocked time through friday which would coincide with the end of the weeks floor votes if that schedule holds the committee would release a detailed summary of the bill today as well according to a committee aide the full bill and committee report wouldnt come until next week hes back cruz joins the ndaa markup sen ted cruz has gone from the presidential campaign trail to the crowded russell senate office building room where the armed services panel is marking up the ndaa and mccain says the texas republican has offered several amendments hes back in the game said mccain who went through the same readjustment after his unsuccessful bid for the white house in 2008 he has to do what everybody has to do when they lose get back in and get to work and thats what hes doing defense bill no 2 house appropriations panel approves the defense spending measure the house defense appropriations subcommittee swiftly cleared the defense spending bill wednesday evening setting the stage for full committee markup expected next week the bill is likely to face democratic opposition over moving 16 billion from the special overseas contingency operations war budget to fund base pentagon operations which democrats have slammed as a gimmick but both defense appropriations subcommittee chairman rodney frelinghuysen rnj and appropriations chairman hal rogers rky defend the move we need increased defense spending and we certainly need investments in more readiness and modernization of equipment frelinghuysen told morning d after wednesdays markup i think most republicans and democrats feel that way and rogers told morning d the bill handles oco as good as we can at the moment asked about a supplemental spending bill next year he said if necessary that will be in the wings if we see the need and defense bill no 3 floor amendments pile up for the house ndaa the defense authorization bill has 359 amendments filed in the house as of wednesday evening a number likely to grow before the full house takes it up next week not all of them will make it to the floor of course the house rules committee will have a say in that the list of amendments includes a proposal from house armed services chairman thornberry to try to slash the size of the national security council to 100 down from an estimated 400 the texas republican has also offered an amendment to remove a provision requiring women to register for the draft and study the issue instead a proposal from reps paul gosar rariz and jackie speier dcalif would cut the number of littoral combat ships from three to two and house armed services ranking democrat adam smith and rep jim clyburn dsc have an amendment pushing for tougher language that would bar the military from supporting academic institutions that fly the confederate flag the amendment is aimed at the citadel a military college in south carolina that still flies the confederate flag lawmakers of both parties take aim at lgbt provision a bipartisan bloc of house lawmakers is gearing up to take on a provision added during committee markup from rep steve russell rokla that critics say would strip away lgbt protections for government contractors provided by president barack obamas executive order the amendment is sponsored by four republicans and four democrats led by rep charlie dent rpa russell argues that opponents are misunderstanding his proposal which he says clarifies ambiguous language on religious freedom smith one of the cosponsors of dents amendment has said hes on the fence over supporting the ndaa because of the funding shift from oco to the base but he also said wednesday the fate of russells proposal will play a role in his ultimate vote im still very worried about the money and also worried about the russell amendment he told morning d if the russell amendment is not turned around that would be a factor as well cbo report the congressional budget office has released its detailed cost estimate and analysis of the

better the year has seen just 283 million rub102 billion in capital invested thus far and with only 25 completed deals to date it will almost surely produce a fouryear low in terms of deal count a big

__label__1 b'dear osvaldo and martin it is very difficult to make considered input into this process at such short notice i received the emails wednesday afternoon just before being away from the office for 48 hours i also am not fully aware of the process into which this is fitting and it is the first time i have seen the wgii outline i do however make some comments on the following the wgii outline chapter 2 on data etc chapter 13 on critical damage etc wgii outline key questions there is in analytical terms very little difference between the 2nd and 4th key question you pose the impacts under unmitigated cc q2 are not in any fundamental way different from the impacts under mitigated cc q4 2degc warming for example will give broadly the same impacts whether this occurs because of strong cc policy intervention or whether it occurs because of low carbon development paths what matters more for impacts is the rate of cc and what matters more for how important those impacts are is the development path pursued i think this distinction between mitigated and unmitigated cc is tenuous and unhelpful this has a bearing on the later discussions about stabilisation where stabilisation is usually assumed to be indeed often synonymous with the result of mitigative action actually quasi stabilisation at different levels can occur in a world with relatively little direct cc mitigation policy the progression through the sections follows a rather linear and reductionist model observed impacts future impacts adaptationregions i would have liked to have seen an early opening chapter on the nature of the dynamic relationship between climate and society before we even start talking about climate change this being able to bring out notions of vulnerability and adaptation both fundamental to put on the table before we start thinking about future climate change and how important it is this could also point out that critical damage is already being caused by climate and climate variability under your structure the observed impacts section ii should surely parallel the later future impacts section iii in terms of sectorsthemes there are only 4 themes in section ii yet 6 different themes in section iii why for example is nothing said about observed impacts on urban infrastructure or on coasts the asymmetry between these section subthemes is itself perhaps revealing it seems odd that adaptation is to be addressed in all the thematic chapters in section iii as well as in a separate later chapter on adaptation this situation is ripe for overlap and redundancy our understanding of adaptation in any case should be brought in right at the beginning see above the avoiding critical damage chapter suffers from the same problem identified above what matters is whether and how such exceedance rates can be identified not whether they result from either a mitigated or an unmitigated scenario this academic distinction cannot be sustained in the real world the regional section is in danger of repeating the mistake in the tar again leading to dispersion of effort and redundancy my suggestion would be not to assess all new regional knowledge again very turgid but instead to produce a much more streamlined section focusing on a few regionallocal case studies that illustrate sharply many of the integrating themes introduced earlier vulnerability adaptation criticality impacts deliberately seek to be selective and not comprehensive i also do not see how the wgii chapters will be coordinated with the 5 crosscutting papers identified here again there seems much scope for duplicitous effort and redundancy or even contradiction and since the crosscutting papers are really the interesting and useful ones this suggests to me that the old traditional wg structure of ipcc is now deeply flawed as i have said more than once before in public chapter 2 assumptions etc first question to raise is what is wgi doing in this regard i cannot comment sensibly without knowing how wgi will tackle questions of scenarios and future projections in section 23 4th bullet how relevant really are these stabilisation scenarios mitigation at the very least ipcc must clear up this issue about whether stabilisation is a shorthand for mitigation as implied here this is potentially misleading since stabilisation can occur in many different worlds by no means all of them worlds with strong cc mitigation policies continuation of this thinking means reality is being forced to accommodate the arbitrary thinking of the unfccc rather than unfccc being forced to take account of reality also in this bullet is impacts of extreme climate events why are impacts being looked at here surely this is totally misplaced what is important are scenarios of whatever origin and methodology that embed within them changes in the character of extreme weather and how we describe such changes we should not separate this out as a separate issue surely section 24 the second appearance confuses me much of this material appears earlier in 23 thus characterisations of future conditions is what 23 is about and also the projected changes in key drivers is what the scenarios part of 23 is all about do you mean to differentiate between methodology 23 and outcomes 24b and as always you will run into the problem of summarising what scenarios actually are assumed in this report is there to be an ipcc 4ar standard scenarios that all should use i suspect not resolving this problem gets to the heart of the structural problem with ipcc different people will use different assumptions chapter 13 critical damage this outline was almost unintelligible to me for example having read the opening aims and scope statement several times i an still not clear about the approach this chapter is taking sections 132 and 133 are also extremely unclear as is section 134 i think someone needs to do some clearer thinking about this chapter before sending it out for people to comment on i have my own views on this but at such short notice and without knowing the agreed ipcc process im not going to write the chapter outline for you inter alia the chapter should address the following different paradigms for defining critical will vary by sector culture etc distinction between external pronounced definitions of critical and internal experiencedperceived definitions relationship between adaptive capacity and critical rates of change dependence of critical thresholds on sector and spatial scale reversibility or not of critical damage and if the use of critical is

__label__1 b'hello everyone additional info provided belowviva ersst refers only to the ocean temperature fields smith et al 2008 described the updates to create ersst version 3 this included the use of in situ and satellite data the paper also presented updates to the land surface temperature lst product and culminated in the computation of the merged landocean surface temperature product however since ca nov 2008 satellite data was removed from the analysis and was called v3b but the methodology is essentially the same as in the paper the reason was that there was a residual cold bias in the satellite data this caused problems for users concerned with rankings we do not handle the page for the lst and merged st product and perhaps there should be more coordination among these webpages we have noticed the confusion about the ersst v3 and v3b in several articles are in the process of updating the webpage the in situ data used for the ersstv3b is icoads the current v3b was computed using icoads release 24 17842007 in july 2009 a new release was made with additional data pre1900s and during the war years but we have no plans yet to reprocess it is during such a reprocessing that we will include any missed data operationally we run the code on the 3rd of each month using the available gts data the baseline for the ersst anomalies is 19712000 for the lst the ghcn box averages are provided to us as anomalies already so i am not sure what the baseline is i just started 3 months ago so i have not worked a lot on the merged product codes yet in the programs there is an adjustment of the lst anomaly to a 19712000 base so the final merged st anomaly has a 19712000 base period the best practice would be to reconstruct the original st by adding the 19712000 base then compare or adjust or change baselines as you please btw my last name is banzon no r alas i am not related to the 261st richest person note the opinions expressed in this email are those of the author alone and do not necessarily reflect official noaa department of commerce or us government policy patria viva f banzon physical scientist remote sensing applications division national climatic data center noaanesdis 151 patton avenue asheville nc 288015001 828 271 4453 tel 8282714328 fax 1vivabanzonnoaagov'

republicans according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the talks senior party officials dont expect the house gop to fully embrace their partys nominee but instead concentrate on speaker

__label__1 b'trump campaign rift gets personal by kenneth p vogel and ben schreckinger 05252016 0517 am edt the internal struggle for control of donald trumps presidential campaign is getting personal with allies of feuding campaign manager corey lewandowski and chairman paul manafort increasingly turning to shadowy tactics to try to sully their rivals the battle which was already toxic even by the standards of notoriously vicious internecine presidential campaign spats escalated last week even as trump moved to clarify the official hierarchy atop his campaign by creating a new position campaign chairman and chief strategist for manafort lewandowskis enemies around the campaign after months of circulating rumors about his personal life had a hand in planting a suggestive item about his emotional argument with a campaign staffer in a new york tabloid according a person with direct knowledge of how the item came to be and lewandowskis rivals also circulated a news report about him shopping a book in an effort to raise questions about his commitment to trumps campaign according to people familiar with the incident lewandowski denied the report lewandowskis supporters in turn have urged trump and his representatives to examine manaforts personal life as well as the lobbying done by manafort and his associates according to people on both sides of the lewandowskimanafort rift perhaps fittingly much of the feud has played out on the same social media battleground and using the same conspiratorial tone that trump himself has exploited to great effect to belittle his rivals but the tugofwar also has potentially serious implications for the presumptive gop nominees general election matchup with likely democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton many individuals familiar with the trump campaign including campaign staffers and people who work with them on the outside say the infighting has infected the campaigns daytoday operations with little communication and mounting distrust among manafort lewandowski and their allies its a total cage fight in there now said an operative close to the campaign manafort tried to take out corey but he didnt succeed and now everywhere corey looks he sees a threat so hes trying to neutralize those threats supporters and opponents of lewandowski say he and his allies have called trumps attention to articles chronicling lobbying work done by manafort or his campaign associates for a gambling company as well as politically problematic foreign clients including saudi arabia multiple prorussian figures and a group accused of being a front for pakistani intelligence an ally of manaforts said lewandowski takes all the bad news up to trump paul represented this person paul represented that person lewandowski and manafort declined to comment as did the trump campaigns press office but even as a tuesday news report revealed that trump was separating the rival factions into distant office spaces in his new york headquarters a campaign official disputed the characterization of an increasingly bitter and damaging divide asserting that the onceskeletal campaign of the billionaire real estate developer had moved past the welldocumented acrimony in its upper ranks corey and paul are actually working very well together right now there is a very clear delineation of roles and responsibilities right now and things are better than they have ever been the official said suggesting that any efforts to undermine manafort or lewandowski reflected only the actions of lowerlevel individuals acting on their own indeed most of the dirty work on both sides of the tugofwar has been conducted not by the principals but by their supporters in and around the campaign for instance a california republican close to the campaign said lewandowski has repeatedly tried to enlist allies on the campaign in his efforts to marginalize manafort hes going to people and saying i need your help we need to get rid of paul said the republican lewandowskis supporters inside the campaign have highlighted accounts of manafort privately assuring leery republican officials that trump will moderate his tone in the general election and act more presidential according to people close to the campaign those reports have bothered the firsttime candidate who has bristled at efforts to restrain the bombastic rhetoric that helped fuel his rise manafort seems acutely aware of the sensitivity of the terrain and he pushed back after politico on friday reported that he told top gop congressional officials that his boss behavior can be changed manafort argued later that he was not referring to trumps behavior but his poll numbers explaining his negatives are going to be changing over the course of the next couple of weeks as republicans come home meanwhile lewandowski for months has been the target of whisper campaigns from a pair of erstwhile trump campaign advisers with whom he had clashed well before manafort came on board in march veteran gop operative roger stone and former stone proteacutegeacute sam nunberg last week nunberg helped facilitate a new york post page six item about an argument between lewandowski and campaign spokeswoman hope hicks on a manhattan sidewalk outside the trump campaign headquarters according to a person with direct knowledge of how the item made its way onto the posts website the person said that nunberg asked an associate to relay information about the exchange to the post which relied on a witness who quoted hicks screaming at lewandowski i am done with you hicks declined to comment for this story as did trump campaign adviser michael caputo another former stone proteacutegeacute who witnessed the incident according to two sources stone said he had nothing to do with the planting of the item and is not responsible about anything sam says or does he acknowledged emailing the page six item to some of his associates after it posted but suggested that was in service of trump it didnt reflect well on the candidate stone said i dont like anything thats harmful to donalds candidacy nunberg would not comment on whether he had a role in the page six item but he suggested trump would be wellserved by firing lewandowski donald loves to fire people why cant he just say it to corey said nunberg who blamed lewandowski for his own firing from the campaign last summer over a yearsold racist facebook post the trump campaign official sought to distance manafort and the campaign as a whole from stone and nunberg declaring theres no association with roger or sam and anyone on the campaign after nunberg was fired from trumps campaign he endorsed trumps nowvanquished gop rival ted cruz and doesnt speak to the billionaire anymore thats not the case for stone the selfstyled dirty trickster who also has advocated conspiracy theories including that lyndon johnson was a leader in the plot to murder john f kennedy worked with manafort for years as partners in a lobbying firm and also advised trump for years before the campaign stone emphasizes that he has no formal role with the campaign but he has fashioned a role for himself as an informal adviser and highprofile surrogate he has waged a monthslong campaign to boost trump and manafort while eviscerating perceived enemies including lewandowski using social media television and radio appearances and his own writing on conservative websites on his expletivefilled twitter feed stone has publicly branded trumps campaign manager loserdowski hes urged trump to question lewandowskis loyalty calling him a snake and comparing him to the serpentine villain in a song trump recites on the stump about a woman who is killed by a snake she had rescued stone also has used twitter to lash out at barry bennett a lewandowski ally on the campaign as brainless and ignorant unpresentable and inarticulate while urging him to stay out of the media you hurt trump every time you open your mouth bennett a senior adviser to the trump campaign wouldnt respond to stones jabs but suggested his public vitriol is not helping trump i have nothing bad to say about anyone who is working to elect donald trump bennett said i dont understand why anyone would think attacking a member of the team moves the ball forward when news broke last week that trump had promoted manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist stone took to twitter to gloat calling it a good decision and mocking lewandowski urging him to call your office but a source with knowledge of the situation said that manaforts allies had leaked the report of manaforts promotion to counteract a recent new york times magazine article that focused much more attention on lewandowskis role on the trump campaign stone tweeted that manaforts promotion made the nearly 7000word story hopelessly dated the target list in stones crusade against lewandowski also has come to include journalists he views as insufficiently skeptical of the campaign managers importance or performance or overly skeptical of manaforts a group that includes reporters at politico and the washington post when the post reported that lewandowski had been tapped to head trumps vice presidential selection process stone accused bennett of being an anonymous source for the story and assailed it as 100 inaccurate bennett declined to comment on whether he played any role in the story stone repeatedly demanded a retraction and launched into a weekslong crusade against the reporter who wrote it accusing him of being conned and worse neither the reporter or corey lewandowski knows his ass from his elbow stone tweeted demanding that the reporter resign or be fired for his false reporting and suggesting that stone intended to chat with his editor this week the post declined to comment in an interview this month with popular libertarian talkshow host alex jones stone argued that lewandowski has aggrandized his role partly by leaking the vice presidential selection story before pivoting to an ironic plea for unity on the trump campaign campaigns that are divided will lose stone said now donald trump is smart enough to know that open discord in his campaign is not helpful but it is very clear that some in the entourage are more interested in feathering their own nest while others who are consummate political professionals like paul manafort are keeping their head down not playing the press game to try to burnish their own standing and their own image but focusing on getting donald j trump elected president hadas gold contibuted to this report to view

__label__1 b'xflowed hi keith and tim eystein is going to chat with you tomorrow and my goal is to get as much as i can to you guys today and tomorrow first off the figures are great that was tough job and im very impressed of course i can already start to sense what the debates will be but we can address that in the text here are some comments with respect to the figures some are relevant to the text 1 they really are great 2 is the instrumental series on the first fig top and bottom the same as featured in chapter 3 need to say that 3 rather than clogging up the caption with all the notes on each curve how about a table for each of the two figures then you can include some more info on each recon eg number of sites types of proxies im thinking mainly that the captions are not pretty but you may be able to include more summary info on each curve also 4 should we make all the series in their original and modified for the figure form available on a www site so that reviewers can play with the data and make sure they get their two cents in before this thing is all said and published the wdca is ready to help w posting of data and figs see below 5 i like the expanding time axis but id be prepared to have a second one with a linear axis in fact id put it up on the www page at the same time with the data the more we do to help others understand the better 6 also it would be good to see both the data and the figure wo the gaussianweighted filtering what do doe these look like can we make them available as suggested above at the least id like to see the fig wo the filtering even though i know it will be a mess how about a series of time series plots same x and y axes as the big fig 1 in each you show both the filtered and unfiltered series i know this is a pain for tim but we really have to make sure were not missing anything in the data and also that we anticipate what others will do ask us to do or squawk about 7 on the forcing fig fig 2 why dont we see all the different experiment curves eg dotted red in the forcing plots a b and c need to say why in the caption and if they have the same forcing so you cant see it on the plot need to say it this could be much easier in a table that indicates same as x 8 on fig 2 does the recalulated envelop of reconstructed temps also include instrumental temps think so but you should say it in the caption why doesnt the envelop go up to present can it might look better and be more consistent w fig 1 if the envelop cant go to present then maybe include the instrumental curve as in fig 1 9 reminders for the text ill think about these as i read a second time for editing 9a need to explain why the recons dont continue going up w instrumental data at the end post 1990 might what to mention something in caption if you can shift all the other stuff to a table 9b there will be lots of discussion during and post ar4 drafting about what recon series fig 1 should or should not be believed thus i think it is critical for us to same more about each recon that is to include what you wrote in blue and perhaps to enhance need to really convince the reader that while not one recon is alone the truth and hence fig 1 they all have important strengths and weaknesses but the former outweigh the latter so weve included them 9c im sure you saw the recent to be infamous wall stree journal editorial they showed what i think was a ipcc far curve with the good old mwp and lia etc lamb view i dont have the far w me the way to handle the hocky stick might best be to put it in an historical perspective along with the older ipcc views first show your great figs discuss them and what went into them and then after showing the stateoftheart discuss how much our understanding and view have changed in this simply compare each of the historical views far sar tar to the current view and while doing so play down the controversy s especially the hockey stick the smart folks will realize that that the fluff in the news is just that but those with a real stake in that debate will hopefully get the point that it doesnt matter 10 lastly almost im sorry to ask again but i still want to know what is wrong with tom crowleys latest plot with all the recons shown together back through the med w period i need to send you my edits on the mwp box but it seem to me that toms fig could go in that box to help make the point that sorry guys the mwp wasnt much compared to the recent global warming 11 lastly promise dont foget that eystein and i think we can get a page or two extra for your section in the end this means you can do all the above and i can help next with the modes and extremes sections and we can get it all in great job thanks peck'

explosion on a metro subway track along with surprise suspended service and widespread delays may have been the perfect prelude for todays news conference where wmata general manager paul wiedefeld is expected to announce major interruptions to metro service for the coming months those plans will involve weeks of continuous single tracking or short linesegment shutdowns metro spokesman dan stessel told our own lauren gardner wiedefeld told the washington post that the scope of the yearlong maintenance overhaul will be unprecedented for the transit agency but as the region prepares for bad news heres the big question what steps will metro and local dmv officials take to help riders find alternate commuting routes once their triedandtrue routines become untenable its gonna be a doozy though wiedefeld is expected to stay agnostic on the ftavsfra debate he is considering shifting wmata to fra standards for signal track and transportation according to a memo sent wednesday to metro board members absent industry standards for rail transit voluntarily embracing these standards at wmata will provide a solid foundation for achieving a better culture of safety wiedefeld said in the memo its friday good morning and thanks for tuning into politicos morning transportation your daily tipsheet on all things trains planes automobiles and ports mt hereby calls on transportation secretary

transportation association announced that its ceo michael melaniphy was abruptly resigning mt got first bat at a conversation with apta chair valarie mccall and acting president and ceo richard a white the duo declined to comment on the specifics of the resignation reports of leadership infighting as well as allegations that the organization was spending exorbitantly in the time preceding the shakeup we are moving forward what we dont want to do is to get into the weeds of what people may be saying mccall insisted read nondisclosure agreement but they did give some indication of the steps the organization will take in coming months to get back in the good graces of members and amid talk of focusing on the future and one of those things that will make us stronger as an organization they also hinted that they recognize spots where the longtime institution may have gone wrong on the plan going forward theyve got several task forces aimed at looking at issues such as the organizations governance and finances and most of all they said theyre listening to members concerns reform will be high on the list of discussion items at two major apta meetings planned for the coming weeks i think the main thing were focused on right now is listening to our members listening to our stakeholders and reinforcing our value mccall said its about looking at where we can focus our strengths to be better aligned with our members on that stinging mta letter white said the organization was already aware of many of the issues outlined before the letter was sent and the response to those concerns he said have been in motion for a while white also intimated that theyre hoping mta reconsiders its exit after apta rethinks the structure of its membership dues funding model and spending priorities and mta officials look at those options on finances one task force will be focused specifically on how the organization is collecting and spending money the mtas letter complained that the number of meetings resulted in the public perception of these conferences as wasteful boondoggles before quitting the mta paid apta 400000 per year its all on the table to be evaluated both the dues and the registration costs white said we want to make sure we dont have a tin ear on the kinds of things that members are saying that we need to address on the governance structure one of the mtas big knocks on apta was the notion that the organizations board and executive committee failed to adequately represent legacy transit systems and also lacked the geographic diversity of the organizations members white acknowledged that criticism we got a little outofbalance over the last few years and we didnt so intentionally white said but the unintended consequence was that an imbalance got created and it needs to be dealt with soon and its going to be dealt with soon next moves on csx dc del eleanor holmes norton may use last weekends csx derailment as an opportunity to push legislative changes

__label__1 b'dear mike thanks for your detailed response about your use of the sres scenarios im sure it will be useful to bob watson i wish i could explain better what bobs problem entails it is intensely political my judgement is that if i tell you more then this will indirectly help bob in answering the questions posed of him by sensenbrenner particularly should bob need to get back to you please note that this is confidential information please note too that i am making my own judgement on this in the interest of clarifying a complex issue i have not been authorized by bob or anyone associated with ipcc to divulge this information the stated concern of sensenbrenner is that the use of the sres scenarios prior to their ratification might in some way jeopardize ipccs independence and objectivity sensenbrenner apparently uses as guidelines in making his judgement ipccs principles as approved in vienna austria in october 1998 together with june 11 and 28 1999 letters giving appendix a to the principles which is entitled procedures for the preparation review acceptance approval and publication of ipcc reports which was approved in april 1999 sensenbrenner implies that these documents raise concerns about the use of preliminary ipcc material by dr wigley and the pew center on global climate change for nonipcc purposes apparently without ipcc sanction he considers that these issues are significant because they relate directly to the integrity of the ipcc process in my case i bypassed the ipcc process by obtaining permission in writing from the 4 groups who produced the marker scenarios i did not acknowledge the ciesin web site in your case apparently you did the problem here is that this site stated very clearly that the data were not for citation or quotation did you take notice of this my view is and has always been that contributors to such data sets or distribution sites do not give up the intellectual property rights to their own data they could do so of course by signing appropriate legalcopyright documents but i have never done this nor as far as i know has anyone who contributed to the ciesin site this is why i went to the individual authors in order to obtain permission to use their data in my pew report i hope you can see that there is an important difference between what you did and what i did at face value it would appear that you have ignored the clearlystated message that the ciesin site data were not for citation or quotation more on this point below you refer back to the july 1998 bureau meeting agreeing that the preliminary sres scenarios in your words could and should be used by scientists from my reading of the background material this is subtly wrong the bureau only agreed that the data could be used by the gcm modeling community as it happens i am part of that community and i acted as the interface between the scenarios and the rest of the ncar gcm team providing sres data to them in a form that could be used for our gcm runs i do not think you can claim to have filled this particular and quite specific role in your work however there are some interesting subtleties here that i think vindicate your position the issue is what is meant by the gcm modeling community in my view anyone who uses gcm data either to provide data sets to the impacts community or to carry out diagnostic studies directly to improve gcms is part of this community note that this does not allow one to include the impacts modelers as part of the gcm community the two stated aspects are precisely what you do furthermore scengen which i presume you have used in your work makes direct use of gcms in order to produce spatiallyspecific climate results based on any given emissions scenarios including the sres scenarios the scengen method is simply an alternative way of translating emissions scenarios into gcmbased and gcmtype output in my view anyone using the sres scenarios in the development of scengen or applying scengen to produce spatiallyspecific climate results for dissemination to others must be included as part of the gcm modeling community referred to in the bureaus agreement regarding use of the sres scenarios you may have interpreted the bureaus statements even more broadly than this but this is of no consequence since what you have done also falls squarely within the more restricted interpretation that i have given above nevertheless i think it would have been wiser for you to have done things the way i did rather than to have acknowledged the ciesin site as your source the next issue raised in your email concerns the ddc i have not looked at this site but i presume it duplicates what was on the ciesin site if so then its use and the use of the preliminary sres data must be controlled by the rules under which the ddc was set up and operates the key questions therefore are 1 do these rules allow the use of these data by anyone 2 do the sres data as it appears on this site include the statement not for citation or quotation 3 does this make moot the whole issue of the use of the sres scenarios in other words if these data are available to all and sundry with no restrictions through ddc then no one can complain about their use although in your case since you acknowledged ciesin rather than ddc you may still be subject to criticism what this could amount to is a loophole in the ipcc rules of procedure sensenbrenner might then argue that this loophole should be closed by clarifying and tightening the rules for the ddc the bottom line is that i think you have done things in a perfectly legitimate way even acknowledging the ciesin site is legitimate since your primary application was in the production of climate change scenarios as a member of the gcm modeling community as i believe this community should be defined you have then distributed these results to the global climate impacts community who in turn will be feeding their results back into the ipcc process through wgii your chosen method of distribution especially the wwf pathway might be judged as less than ideal but i cannot see anything that you have done that goes explicitly or implicitly against ipcc regulations below the bottom line is the concern expressed by sensenbrenner that these actions yours and mine might in some way have undermined the integrity of the ipcc process it would be interesting to hear from sensenbrenner just how he thinks that might have happened all we have done is distribute credible and defensible scientific information if this information were to be in conflict with the currently bestavailable science this might be an issue of concern but it is not the more such credible scientific information is distributed to the community particularly when it is presented in an easilyread nontechnical yet authoritative way the better i can see no way that this can distort the ipcc process some people however appear to think that it might a less kind interpretation might be that they are just trying to slow down the process by tying it up in legal and procedural knots but i have no evidence that this is what they are trying to do i hope you can see from the above quotes and somewhat convoluted arguments what a legal and political minefield this is these sorts of issues do not seem to arise outside of the usa but here they take on an enormous importance one must tread very cautiously cheers tom'

__label__1 b'xflowed dear olga i deeple apologize for haveing not read your email earlier i was so overburden with other obligations when coming back from beijing that i gave myself the deadline of june 1 to start with ipcc work as usual circumstances have forced me to postpone this dedaline to next monday for this i had not realised that chapter 6 has its first deadline tomorrow i have now gone through the glaiers during the lia and glaciers during the mwp paragraphs as well as through the glacier bullet you send today i think the lia paragraph fits well into the chapter 4 as a supplement to the observations we concentrate on the mwp is a bit out of focus observations as i mentioned earlier i would be glad if chapter 6 could give glaciers approprate space as being the only climate proxies which are exclusively governed by physical processes and are thus much safer to interpret than any other proxies the fact that they give filtered information as a mean over longer time periods enables them to represent climate over the last years glaciologists have started to investigate the impact of climate seasonality on glaciers and have also started to separate thermal and hygric variables driving glaciers all this deserves much attention also beyond the observations to be coverd in chapter 4 a comment on the bullet this is fine the only point i would change is the one mentioning africa for lewis glacier mount kenya advances have been reconstructed from moraines aoroud 1900 and measured thickening took place in the 1970s rwenzori glaciers have advanced in the late 1960s and early 1970s a compilation of this is attached as well as a figure and a table from an ongoing compilation of the postlia retreat of tropical glaciers i am working on please keep them confidential note from this figure also the exception kilimanjaro glaciers play they have to be seen separately from anything else we observe in the tropics mainly because of the absolute lack of movement on the plateau there are also other reasons which would go beyond a readable email so to make the long story short i afrikan glaciers are no exception to the global picture and ii kilimanjaro glaciers are an exception in africa in the tropics and on the global picture thus kili glaciers should not be used as an example neither for africa nor for the tropics although i am highly interested in kilimanjaro myself running a reserach project there i strongly suggest to not overestimate its glaciers accoding to a request from suasan solomon i will address that briefly in chapter 45 by the way kili glaciers only cover 26 km2 out of 2500 km2 in the tropics see table in attachement hope this is of help and if you have any further question feel free to contact me best wishes georg georg kaser institut fuer geographie innrain 52 a6020 innsbruck tel 43 512 507 5407 fax 43 512 507 2895 link'

__label__1 b'secondo me ti fa gola gizmodo a 49port usb hub still isnt enough so how many ports on a usb hub are too many theres no answer to that question because no matter how many you have youll always need at least one more but brandos new 49port usb charging hub should keep you satisfied for at least a little whilestop and think about just how many devices you have at work or home that can be charged via usb from smartphones to smartwatches to childrens toys to the miscellaneous laptop accessories around your desk all of a sudden 49 ports doesnt seem that obsceneat 174 it isnt cheap and youll need to supply your own atx power supply just like youd find in a desktop computer and its limited to a max output of just 15a at each port so larger devices like tablets might not be able to charge from it but everything else is fair game and while this is mostly designed for it departments who want to keep an endless supply of devices charged for employees it would also make for the perfect central charging hub at home brando via the red ferret journal'
__label__1 b'dear colleagues a meeting was held today on sres scenarios during the ipcc plenary session in vienna the meeting was organized by david griggs fortunaat joos richard moss and rob swart also present were a number of delegates including two cochairs of ipcc john houghton from wgi and bert metz from wgiii attached is a document with issues discussed during this meeting the meeting was very productive in my view even though it was quite brief two key issues were discussed that are listed in the attachment 1 incomplete information concerning sres emissions as reported on the website and 2 consistency and plausibility of sres scenarios and their emissions 1 incomplete information there appeared to be a general consensus that the range of co2 emissions especially energyrelated ones are in quite good agreement across the sres scenarios once one adds the missing emissions categories to all model runs they are also in a relatively good agreement with the ranges given in sar the sres ranges of ch4 and n2o emissions did not appear to be a problem in themselves but they are considerably lower than the ranges given in sar it was agreed to ask the sres writing team to further harmonize the ranges for the base year and the period 1990 to 2000 across the scenarios for co2 ch4 and n2o at the same time david griggs will contact the colleagues from wgi to inquire whether the emissions ranges for these gases as given in sar have changed in the mean time and will inform the sres colleagues soon about the result in particular he will check whether the nonenergy co2 ch4 and n2o emissions ranges are still appropriate as best guess for the 1990 situation and about any new numbers about the ranges for more recent years it was also suggested that the sres writing team discuss the reasons for relatively low ch4 emissions in 1990 compared with the sar range most of the sres models do not generate cfc and hfc emissions but these emissions are important for climate models it was agreed that david griggs will inquire with climate modelers whether they really need all species of these gases or whether it is sufficient to report their joint emissions sres team is to report whether these emissions could be added to most of the model runs and over which timescale joergen fenhann is in touch with a number of colleagues on this issue already and he is planning to make a specific proposal how to handle this question across sres scenarios sres sulfur emissions are considerably lower than the is92 range there are a number of reasons for this difference that were discussed at the meeting it was decided that this exchange should continue in the future so that there is a better understanding of all issues involved this is a new aspect of sres scenarios that represents an important change since is92a a change that was also suggested by the 1994 ipcc review of emissions scenarios the concern raised by hugh pitcher in the wgi scenario discussion group about high productivity growth in a1 scenarios was briefly mentioned this issue is to be settled within the sres writing team possibly by including the formulation of alternative scenario variants 2 consistency and plausibility most participants of the meeting expressed the need to have emissions trajectories that are somehow normalized for all sres scenarios for 1990 and that have the same trends through 2000 and diverge only thereafter across different scenarios this would meet the need of climate modelers to work with the same starting points for all scenarios they model one suggestion was that sres team simply takes midpoints of emissions ranges in 1990 and renormalizes all sres emissions another proposal is that climate modelers suggest their preferred values for 1990 to be used in renormalization in any case the method that is used would need to be well documented and cited in the relevant ipcc reports this is necessary so as not to introduce an artificial impression that there is a full agreement on baseyear emissions across sres scenarios there were no specific suggestions how to harmonize shortterm emissions through 2000 this issues is to be discussed within the sres writing team and within the climate modeling community in order to collect emissions data for the last years that could be used for such harmonization the issue was discussed of generally lower co2 and so2 emissions across the range of sres scenarios and in particular for b2 marker this results in lower ghg forcing and lower negative so2 forcing the total forcing remains roughly the same as in is92a but has fundamentally different implications especially at regional level most of the climate models will be in the position to use just a few scenarios in some case may be just two possible ways of avoiding the impression that there is a preferred scenario were discussed and there was a consensus that somehow the message needs to be conveyed that the whole set of sres scenarios is plausible and that there is really no single central case that can be compared with is92a climate models need gridded so2 emissions while sres models generate so2 emissions for a number world regions mike schlesinger and steve smith will attend the next sres meeting and it was suggested that mike would use his method to produce gridded so2 emissions and that steve would use the method proposed by tom wigley to do the same this way there would be two alternative gridded emissions patterns for all sres scenarios available to user groups in conclusion it was agreed that it would be useful to organize an informal meeting where sres colleagues could meet with potential user groups from tar especially from wgi and wgii next possibility to do so would be on the occasion of the wgi meeting in paris 30 november to 3 december i am not quite sure that i got the dates right the next communication will be more precise regards naki attachment converted ceudoraattachsresw1rtf'

__label__1 b'dear geoff it good to hear from you by now you may know that we had a small working meeting to consider the current draft of the thematic bid yesterday in london simon tett nick shackleton paul valdes and i really did get to grips with a lot of the important details concerning the way in which such a project might actually run we are going for a joint earth scienceatmospheric science board application for 8 million to run over 5 years simon told us about your offer of some support perhaps as money perhaps as some equivelent and the spirit of the offer is much appreciated frankly the fact that you consider this a worthy and valid scientific exercise is what really gives me cheer we have a long way to go to really sort out many of the problems with the palaeo data and with the methodology of using them in a validation andor detection context but i genuinely believe this approach will yield rewards somewhere down the line i think our support from the earth science side is very probable the politics of the atmospheric board and the potential clash with other initiatives coming from reading mean that their support in any meaningful sense cant be thought of as more than possible i suppose we may have something like a near 50 chance of eventually getting some money but 50 is pretty good i will now ammend the document to show an explicit requirement for formal supervisory input on the programme from the hadley centre and i acknowledge that there will be no blanket release of data whatever happens i will forward the application to you soon if we get through the outline agreement stage with nerc we will surely revisit these practical details along with others for now i simply say thanks to you and john for your support and thanks for the input of simon and peter cox i will stay in touch as and when things develop even if we fail here the science imperative will mean that we find other means of working with you most likely through an ec grant on these issues thanks again and i hope you are bearing up under the strain of recent troubles keith'

__label__1 b'thanks in the interest of time i took a very quick look through the agreement here are my thoughts 1 i think the format would work better if this was in the form of an agreement rather than a letter agreement it is generally how the company would memorialize something like this it is more in line with their format and it would solve the issue i have with par 1 where we are not \xe2\x80\x9cagreeing\xe2\x80\x9d to anything despite how it is drafted 2 is it necessary for each of the sony entities to be parties does it include any entity that is not currently a party to an agreement with mark e 3 do we really want to define each company individually as \xe2\x80\x9csony\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s please think it through and make sure that the \xe2\x80\x9cindividually and collectively\xe2\x80\x9d is in our best interest i understand why it would make the drafting easier but would hate for separate entities to pick up obligations of another simply bc they are defined a certain way please double check that it works or change appropriately 4 in par 2 think it would be better to make clear that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t giving up anything wise i think the language in the agreement is clear but since we know that is the biggest hurdle to overcome in our draft vs theirs maybe a more finessed approach would work perhaps ending the first sentence after the word effective date and moving the proviso up to the beginning of a new sentence 5 in par 2 d and 2 e we should specify under what agmts the is due 6 i assume bob is comfortable and steve has approved giving on the pointagreeing that he gets paid if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t done a long form by august i am not suggesting it isn\xe2\x80\x99t fine just want to make sure since i don\xe2\x80\x99t recall it every coming up before they dropped it into their draft 7 in par 4 \xe2\x80\x93 think we should be clear about logistics \xe2\x80\x93 we can\xe2\x80\x99t put ourselves in position of being in breach if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t designate etc these payments go way out way in time perhaps saying that it goes into same account unless he has designated a different one which he can do at any time or from time to time etc 8 in par 4 a b c a take out the words \xe2\x80\x9cas the same may be amended or extended\xe2\x80\x9d b be more specific about the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9ctherein\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 as those terms are defined in par'

against turnberry doral development jeffrey soffer and jacquelyn soffer over a 12 million mortgage that was originated by bankatlantic the lawsuit was not a foreclosure but sought to force the borrowers to repay the loan south florida business journaljanuary 24 2014 settlement appears likely in fontainebleau las vegas bankruptcy case fontainebleau las vegas the soffers are on the verge of settling with creditors over the debacle once known as the fontainebleau las vegas a stillskeletal 2 billion high rise in sin city that ranks as one of the biggest busts of the us real estate crisis a federal bankruptcy judge in miami said wednesday he was inclined to approve a 178 million settlement that would pay contractors on the failed casino tower about 25 cents on the dollar contractors would divvy up about 85 million for a total claims pool of 600 million but which a creditor lawyer said would probably end up closer to 350 million once negotiations are finished the money will be paid out to creditors and lawyers in arbitration or by court order a process that could add another year or two onto a case that began with a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in june 2009 construction lenders would recoup about 89 million i certainly have sympathy for all of the people who have money coming to them and seem to have been waiting forever judge a jay cristol told an audience about 70 lawyers half of them participating by speaker phone at an afternoon hearing in downtown miami the settlement money would come from the 93 million in sale proceeds paid by corporate raider carl icahn when he bought the unfinished tower out of bankruptcy in 2010 the money has been in an frozen escrow account pending the bankruptcy outcome an additional 33 million would come from title companies that backed the project as well as from a 50 million completion guarantee funded by jeff soffer and his sister jacquelyn the brotherandsister team run the familys real estate firm turnberry which got its start with the creation of aventura and now includes both the aventura mall and the fontainebleau miami beach the 68story fontainebleau vegas is described in court papers as essentially a teardown valuable for its land on the north end of the strip but burdened by a fiveyearold unfinished tower that icahn may demolish while judge cristol said the settlement would probably meet his approval he said he would consider written objections by a las vegas contractor who wanted its 1 million lawsuit against jeff soffer protected from the settlement a 50 million settlement by mr soffer to get out of all the problems he is currently facing is not a large amount said henry marinello a miami lawyer representing the tracy and ryder landscape inc a large nevadabased landscaping contractor the settlement would end claims by lenders and contractors in the bankruptcy case but the soffers still face litigation involving the fontainebleau vegas jeff soffer the lead developer in both fontainebleau projects has blamed the vegas debacle on lehman brothers cutting off funds after it collapsed in 2008 followed by some of the nations top banks holding back about 800 million in construction funds slated for completing the project but lenders accused soffer and his development team at turnberry of mismanagement and overspending allegations repeated by the bankruptcy trustee in a separate suit seeking damages from soffer and his top executives that litigation is still pending and will not be covered by the settlement the soffers did not attend the hearing jeff soffer presided over fontainebleau vegas and put in 30 million cash collateral for the 50 million completion guarantee before the project started in 2007 his sister became part of the guarantee when she bought a judgment from a lender that had successfully sued to force jeff to pay the remaining 20 million both soffers claimed they should get the money back since the funds could only be used to complete a project that now had no hope of being finished the two essentially surrendered their claims to the money as part of the settlement said mario romine general counsel for turnberry associates soneet kapila a fort lauderdale accountant appointed as bankruptcy trustee for the case blamed the four years leading up to the a settlement on the fact that the case is one of the most complicated ever to be heard in south florida when it is highlevel and sophisticated litigation there are a lot of things to resolve he said its the nature of it the miami heraldnovember 13 2013 previously

millions for personal guarantees on financing for the stalled hotelcasinoresort complex in las vegas which carl icahn purchased for 156 million in january 2010 the soffer family and turnberry also have counterclaims against the las vegas resorts lenders the counterclaims which use details from an examiners report about the collapse of lehman said lehman hid its true financial condition jeff soffer signed a settlement agreement with the bank in january but the counterclaims are still pending as part of the agreement deutsche bank link assigned to jackie soffer all of its rights title and interest in the causes of action actually asserted in this action including the right to have judgment entered against the defendants herein a logical question is why would a bank substitute a defendants sister in collecting the judgement attempts to obtain an explanation regarding the matter from the soffers or their spokesman david satterfield were not successful by deadline other attorneys offered several possible reasons jackie soffer might have reached a lower settlement figure with the bank the family might have wanted to equitably share the financial impact the switch might be part of a broader legal strategy regarding debts related to the las vegas resort the judgment for jackie soffer was registered with the new york state supreme court and signed by judge judith

draws fire in suit a bitter legal fight has erupted between one of south floridas biggest business celebrities jeffrey soffer of the turnberry companies and bruce weinerlink a former ceo of turnberry residential lp the litigation has turned nasty with weiner alleging that soffer siphoned millions of dollars from turnberry companies for upkeep of his baronial lifestyle the suit is the latest in a string of legal and financial entanglements for soffer who was forced to abandon his largest project the 3 billion fontainebleau las vegas in a bankruptcy soffer is famous for flashy spending driving racecars and dating supermodels including elle macphersonlink weiner takes direct aim at those spending habits in his lawsuit among the dramatic examples of jeff soffers abuse was a multimilliondollar 40th birthday he threw for himself that was headlined by a live performance by prince weiner alleges in his complaint tabloids estimated the party alone cost 2 million soffer fired the first shot in the battle after firing weiner in may 2010 he alleged in miamidade county circuit court that weiner betrayed turnberry by privately negotiating to provide development services to orlandobased starwood vacation ownership on its new project the st regis bal harbor resort turnberry alleged that weiner as ceo of turnberry residential violated his fiduciary duties as an officer by forming a new company bal star llc and arranging the starwood deal turnberry alleged weiner had the obligation to bring the st regis deal to them also named in the suit is robert vollrathlink turnberrys former cfo weve alleged that turnberry at this point owns the starwood deal turnberry attorney michael olinlink said turnberry made these guys very wealthy people at the end of the day they went off on their own and took the starwood deal for themselves they violated all their fiduciary duties to their employer circuit judge gill freemanlink rejected turnberrys first complaint telling attorneys it was not clear enough about the corporate structure of the turnberry companies and what duties weiner and vollrath owed to them the company is preparing to refile the suit in the meantime weiner filed his own counterclaim against turnberry naming soffer and his sister jacquelyn sofferlink in the suit fort lauderdale lawyer tom angelolink is one of weiners attorneys their filing the lawsuit necessitated bruce filing his counterclaim angelo said bruce felt it was very unfortunate given the fact he was there 20 years working with them according to weiners lawsuit he was a 5 percent owner of turnberry residential the suit says he and the soffers took out loans from turnberry residential when it was financed in 2004 with a 200 million loan and credit line from prudential real estate investors weiners lawsuit says he repaid his loan of 4 million within the required two years but he alleges that jeffrey soffer took out 100 million and jacquelyn sofferlink took out 40 million and that the two combined failed to repay a combined 40 million by the end of 2008 according to weiners suit the soffers then caused the company to reclassify the loans as distributions without offering weiner the same privilege weiner alleges he should have received 5 percent of that 40 million distribution weiner also alleges he is still owed money from commissions on sales at turnberrys 1881 rosslyn a large luxury condominium in arlington va with views of the washington monument olin scoffed at the notion that turnberry owes any money to weiner hes out to lunch he said of weiners claims the turnberry complaint alleges that weiner and vollrath were so wrapped up in their starwood plans that they allowed costly delays at the 1881 rosslyn project despite the litigation turnberrys website still referred to weiner as the ceo of turnberry residential on feb 22 it calls weiner a driving force in the development and sales of more than 16000 homes and a highly regarded real estate development sales and marketing executive turnberrys media office said in an email that it does not comment on litigation angelo said weiner was not bound by any noncompete clause in fact he had a contract as a partner that specifically allowed him to do business outside of turnberry weiners counterclaim alleges that jacquelyn sofferlink twice ordered audits of funds she and her brother received and that the audits determined weiner should have also received distributions the suit does not elaborate on jacquelyn sofferlinks motive for the audits or the results of the audits miami real estate consultant lewis goodkinlink said turnberry has so far weathered the economic downturn but the end of the current real estate crisis is proving a bitter chapter for many similar companies relationships like theirs usually dont go sour until the market goes sour goodkin said thats the kind of mess that we see people get into south florida business journal february 25 2011 banks target soffers vegas center the soffer family is facing a legal fight to retain control over one of its las vegas projects lenders are trying to foreclose on town square las vegas the massive mixeduse retail and office project

foreclose on town square the bank heads a group of lenders that made a 449 million construction loan to an affiliate of the aventurabased turnberry associates headed by siblings jeff and jackie soffer lehman is involved because it made a 72 million loan to town square and was supposed to provide permanent financing for the project bank of nova scotia link began foreclosure proceedings last summer

ownership stake in the property at the southern end of the las vegas strip were still in the negotiating process jackie soffer said were still overseeing the property were looking to have a positive outcome this week the fight rolled over into the lehman brothers link bankruptcy court case as bank of nova scotia link argued that lehman brothers link is not a party to the town square mortgage the bank wants a judge to find that lehman has no property interest in the mall this filing is not a surprise mike wethington general manager of town square las vegas said in a statement the bank of nova scotia link filed this action in the lehman brothers link bankruptcy case simply to protect its interest in the mall the town square project is the second soffer project in las vegas to suffer as part

__label__1 b'dear all so now it seems that were separating providing the code from running the code i cant see the purpose of one without the other even if mike complies i suspect there will need to be several sessions of interaction which neither side will be very keen on as i said before i know the code will involve lots of combinations for different periods with different proxies also i would expect knowing the nature of the pctype regression approach that there will be library routines if the code is sent there needs to be conditions we dont want mcintyre mm to come out and say he cant get it to work after a few days so it is far some simple im still against the code being given out mike has made the data available that is all they should need the method is detailed in the original paper in the online methods and also in several other papers mike has written as an aside mike is now using a different method from mbh98 also as an aside whilst weve been deliberating mm have submitted another comment on mbh98 to another journal in this they say they have a program that replicates mbh98 although it isnt very convincing that they have it exactly right as they never show a like for like comparison but most of the comment goes on about the results being different due to different combinations of proxies the latter isnt surprising it might appear they want the code to check whether their version works properly if this is the case then there are issues of ipr so if they get the code how do we stop them using it for anything other than this review cheers phil'
__label__1 b'xflowedsorry this kept you awakebut i have also found it a rather alarming graph first a disclaimerexplanation the graph patches together 3 things mann et al nh mean annual temps 2 sigma standard error for ad10001980 instrumental data for 19811998 ipcc do not quote do not cite projections for global temperature for the next 100 years relative to 1998 the range of shading represents several models of projected emissions scenarios as input to gcms but the gcm mean global temperature output as i understand it was then reproduced by sarah rapers energy balance model and it is those values that are plotted keith pointed this out to me i need to go back read the ipcc tar to understand why they did that but it makes no difference to the first order resultneither does it matter that the projection is global rather than nhthe important point is that the range of estimates far exceeds the range estimated by mann et al in their reconstruction keith also said that the hadley center gcm runs are being archived at cru so it ought to be possible to get that data and simply compute the nh variability for the projected period add that to the figure but it will not add much real information however getting such data would allow us to extract say a summer regional series for the arctic and to then plot it versus the holocene melt record from agassiz ice caporwell you can see other possiblities at this point keith alverson throws up his hands in despair at the ignorance of nonmodel amateurs but there are real questions to be asked of the paleo reconstruction first i should point out that we calibrated versus 19021980 then verified the approach using an independent data set for 18541901 the results were good giving me confidence that if we had a comparable proxy data set for post1980 we dont our proxybased reconstruction would capture that period well unfortunately the proxy network we used has not been updated and furthermore there are manysome tree ring sites where there has been a decoupling between the longterm relationship between climate and tree growth so that things fall apart in recent decadesthis makes it very difficult to demonstrate what i just claimed we can only call on evidence from many other proxies for unprecedented states in recent years eg glaciers isotopes in tropical ice etc but there are at least two other problems keith briffa points out that the very strong trend in the 20th century calibration period accounts for much of the success of our calibration and makes it unlikely that we would be able be able to reconstruct such an extraordinary period as the 1990s with much success i may be misquoting him somewhat but that is the general thrust of his criticism indeed in the verification period the biggest miss was an apparently very warm year in the late 19th century that we did not get right at all this makes criticisms of the antis difficult to respond to they have not yet risen to this level of sophistication but they are on the scent furthermore it may be that mann et al simply dont have the longterm trend right due to underestimation of low frequency info in the very few proxies that we used we tried to demonstrate that this was not a problem of the tree ring data we used by rerunning the reconstruction with without tree rings and indeed the two efforts were very similar but we could only do this back to about 1700 whether we have the 1000 year trend right is far less certain one reason why i hedge my bets on whether there were any periods in medieval times that might have been warm to the irritation of my coauthors so possibly if you crank up the trend over 1000 years you find that the envelope of uncertainty is comparable with at least some of the future scenarios which of course begs the question as to what the likely forcing was 1000 years ago my money is firmly on an increase in solar irradiance based on the 10be data another issue is whether we have estimated the totality of uncertainty in the longterm data set used maybe the envelope is really much larger due to inherent characteristics of the proxy data themselvesagain this would cause the past and future envelopes to overlap in ch 7 we will try to discuss some of these issues in the limited space available perhaps the best thing at this stage is to simply point out the inherent uncertainties and point the way towards how these uncertainties can be reduced malcolm i are working with mike mann to do just that i would welcome other thoughts and comments on any of this ray'

nominal valuation of 40 billion partly because of the influx of nontraditional preipo investors getty images by christopher mims dec 29 2014 718 pm et investors have been cautious about technology companies since the first tech bubble when startups with no revenue and skyhigh valuations disappeared almost overnight after markets came to their senses and if we define \xe2\x80\x9cbubble\xe2\x80\x9d as a stockmarket bubble tech isn\xe2\x80\x99t in onethat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that money is pouring into startups and they are spending it recklessly whether on perks for highvalue employees or record rents for office space in san francisco and elsewhere\xe2\x80\x9cthere are pockets of exuberance\xe2\x80\x9d says scott kupor managing partner at venturecapital firm andreessen horowitz \xe2\x80\x9cthere are definitely some valuations that cause you to scratch your head and say \xe2\x80\x98gee we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure how people get to these numbers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9dwhat\xe2\x80\x99s different in 2014 from the bubble that climaxed in 2000 is how money is getting into these companies vast pools of capital\xe2\x80\x94including institutional investors and sovereignwealth funds\xe2\x80\x94are seeking returns amid nearzero interest rates they have figured out that one way to get them is by funding companies earlier in their life cycles before they go public that\xe2\x80\x99s the short explanation for the stratospheric valuations of companies like uber technologies whose nominal worth is 40 billionthe way the venturecapital game traditionally works is that limited partners with all the money hand it to venture capitalists who are supposed to have all the expertisenow everyone considers himself an expert in which tech companies deserve money and how much conventional vcs seek giant payoffs when they exit their investments to offset losses on most of the companies they fund but today\xe2\x80\x99s large institutional investors are happy with returns that beat the broader stock market says mr kupor so they are piling onas upfront ventures vc mark suster outlined in a july blog post hedge funds mutual

earliest rounds of financing economist nouriel roubini known as \xe2\x80\x98dr doom\xe2\x80\x99 has voiced concern about tech and socialmedia stocks tk many startup founders view this investment as necessary to capture markets before their competitors can as they race for mindshare and real estate on your smartphone\xe2\x80\x99s home screen but that also means these startups are losing money even if they have significant revenue because they are using their war chest to buy a share of the market that\xe2\x80\x99s how 2014 isn\xe2\x80\x99t so different from 2000what\xe2\x80\x99s different is pretty much everything else nearly all of these companies insist that they could make money if they wanted the \xe2\x80\x9cunit economics\xe2\x80\x9d of their business models work out they tell themselves and their investors meaning that at least they aren\xe2\x80\x99t losing money on every transactionbut they are losing money on other things whether it\xe2\x80\x99s sales and marketing or

__label__1 b'david sounds promising so the bottom line is that a little disagreement is ok thats a reflection of the real uncertainty but the discrepancy is not all that big in the end no need to take this to a higher level keith briffa is back on line and finishing off section 65 so you might want to send him an email w suggestions that help keep chap 6 compatible w 2 and 9 for example with respect to solar we acknowledge the forcing could be less than 05 wm2 and the uncertaintly wrt to trop aerosols and land albedo is significant we could easily be closer to chap 9s estimate would you say the key is that our analysis acknowledge the uncertainty so as to overlap well with the other chapters keith please make sure you send your new 65 to david too while you were out he was working hard w chap 2 and 9 to make sure we the ipcc avoid saying things that confuse the comparison of radiative forcings from 3 different angles is what assessment is all about and its great david has had the patience to help figure it all out thx peck hi gabi the key to your proposed solution is the updated numbers from chapter 2 if indeed the radiative forcing change to 1750 is 153 then presumably you have made this consistent with the earlier part of chapter 9 the numbers previously looked like this i havent seen the latest version of 65 but ive included the previous estimates we had in the zod wm2 chapter 6 chapter 9 mm 1750 greenhouse gases 24 26 trop aerosols 05 02 solar 05 01 volcanic land albedo 04 003 trop o3 035 04 strat o3 015 010 1st indirect aerosol forcing 12 strat h2o 013 aviation 002 total 22 17 there is essentially no change in greenhouse gas forcing from 1750 to 1700 see for example crowley et al grl 2003 so the difference in the estimated numbers is probably due to inclusion of more things or different choices in chapter 2 a similar statement holds for trop aerosols one can also use these two to presume that the same also holds true for land albedo the value listed for that in chapter 9 is quite small compared to some other studies eg govindasamy et al grl 28 2912942001 so to the extent these numbers are still discussed in chapter 6 they should be made consistent with those in chapters 2 and 9 with respect to your proposed paragraph below i would drop the comments about trace gas differences but saying land albedo changes may have been greater along with the additional solar change could give us the 18 wm2 forcing concerning the temperature response the moberg et al paper itself claims 1c difference between 1500 and 2000 but the figure seems to show a larger number perhaps 13c again just eyeballing it however the coldest time period is not in the mm but before it i think therefore a better estimate from that paper for the mm would be 1c so with respect to the sensitivity if 085 wm2 is unresolved then we have a total forcing of 095 wm2 and a climate response varying between 045c and 1c or a climate sensitivity for 2xco2 of 19c to 42c or pretty similar to standard ipcc estimates i think this will work david'

__label__1 b'hi prof zhang thanks for your email and good to hear about your book i will send the reference file to the las for them to incorporate as appropriate you will also be editing the zod when its complete or of specific sections before then if you ask the appropriate leader of a section of interest see previous listserv email with this list in case you dont remember from italy regarding 659 i will cc this to dan and ramesh so you can coordinate with them directly this is the process we have adopted for all subsections so we dont waste time with the clas having to relay messages go direct i will also cc to jeanclaude and keith so they make sure they have checked your input many thanks peck dear peck as regards section 659 i shall do my utmost to help den and ramesh but the assistance is to come only after i have read through their draft only in that way can i form an ideal it must be relevant to policy makers i have been accustomed to write about scientific facts now i am confronted with a new problem how to serve the purpose of another style otherwise my suggestions would be of no use i had sent paragraphs to jeanclaunde for section 622 and to keith briffa for section 6321 last nav with best wishes'
__label__1 b'hi ed first all yes i agree that we need a paper that takes a more objective look at where we are now and how we can take things forward in terms of nh temperature reconstructions and possibly global sh spatial etc as keith said we mainly i so far have been planning our version of this hopefully objective assessment and by chance i was sketching out a vague outline of its possible content weve been keeping this fairly close to our chests for now so please keep our plansideas to yourself for the moment there is partial overlap between our ideas and yours so it might be good to do this jointly anyway my current ideas are a number of forum articles the first comparing existing reconstructions but without going into more depth and the other three looking at the way forward ie what should we attempt to do to improve them forum piece 1 comparison of existing reconstructions this has most overlaps with your ideas though i hadnt thought of it being so comprehensive i was thinking more of a comparing original series b comparing them after our recalibration to common target data including discussion of why some things dont change much eg relative positioning of reconstructions though amplitudes can change and of course the comparison of mann et al with and without oceanstropics c maybe a bit on comparison with boreholes though maybe not d uncertainty estimates and how these may decrease with time scale and hence not all reconstructions lie in the mann et al uncertainty ranges forum piece 2 selection of predictand and predictor data a what to try to reconstruct and why it matters eg will we get the wrong spectral shape if we reconstruct ocean sst from landbased proxies plus some on seasonality though jones osborn and briffa cover part of that issue are you aware of that paper in press with jgr b what proxies should be used eg does throwing in poor proxies cause a problem with simple averaging weighted averaging and multivariate regression approaches plus does using precipitation proxies to reconstruct temperature result in the wrong spectral shape forum piece 3 reconstruction methods something here on different methods simple averaging multivariate regression type approaches and different implementation choices eg calibration against trendsfiltered data not entirely sure about this but it would not be new work just would critically appraise the methods used to date and what their theoreticalpotential problemsadvantages might be forum piece 4 estimating uncertainty again not entirely sure yet but this must emphasise the absolute requirement to estimate and use uncertainty when comparing reconstructions against observations or simulations etc then something about how to do it contrasting using calibration residuals verification residuals parameter uncertainty with the type of approach that youve taken bootstrap uncertainty or measures of the eps to look at the common signal with additional uncertainty of how the common signal differs from the predictand so thats it perhaps rather ambitious so maybe a reduction to certain key points might be required i was deliberately avoiding any review of treering contributions and lowfrequency per se thinking that you and keith would be taking the lead on that kind of review one final think to mention is that the emails copied below and the attached file might be of interest to you as an example of something that might go in a comparison paper of existing reconstructions its shows how the recalibrated average of existing reconstructions differs from the average of existing calibrated reconstructions youll see from mike manns initial request below that he was thinking of it as a contribution to the eos rebuttal of soon and baliunas but ive not heard much from him since also tom crowley was very interests in this composite of the reconstructions and i started to converse with him about it but never finished estimating the uncertainty range on the composite series and kind of stopped emailing him but i guess either of them might reproduce this idea sometime if it suits them a visit to talk face to face about all these things would be good keith and i have been talking about how to fit a visit in cheers tim date wed 12 mar 2003 161616 0000 to michael e mann userdomaincom tom crowley userdomaincom phil jones pjonesueaacuk from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk subject re fwd soon baliunas cc malcolm hughes userdomaincom userdomaincom userdomaincom userdomaincom kbriffaueaacuk userdomaincom this is an excellent idea mike in principle at least in practise however it raises some interesting results as i have found when attempting this myself that may be difficult to avoid getting bogged down with discussing the attached pdf figure shows an example of what i have produced nb please dont circulate this further as it is from work that is currently being finished off however im happy to use it here to illustrate my point i took 7 reconstructions and recalibrated them over a common period and against an observed target series in this case landonly aprsep 20n but i get similar results with other choices and this recalibration stage is not critical you will have seen figures similar to this in stuff keith and i have published see the coloured lines in the attached figure in this example i then simply took an unweighted average of the calibrated series but the weighted average obtained via an eof approach can give similar results the average is shown by the thin black line ive ignored the potential problems of series covering different periods this was all done with raw unsmoothed data even though 30yr smoothed curves are plotted in the figure the thick black line is what i get when i recalibrate the average record against my target observed series this is the important bit the recalibrated mean of the reconstructions is nowhere near the mean of the reconstructions it has enhanced variability because averaging the reconstructions results in a redder time series there is less common variance between the reconstructions at the higher frequencies compared with the lower frequencies so the former averages out to leave a smoother curve and the recalibration is then more of a case of fitting a trend over my calibration period 18811960 to the observed trend this results in enhanced variability but also enhanced uncertainty not shown here due to fewer effective degrees of freedom during calibration obviously there are questions about observed target series which series to includeexclude etc but the same issue will arise regardless the analysis will not likely lie near to the middle of the cloud of published series and explaining the reasons behind this etc will obscure the message of a short eos piece it is of course interesting not least for the comparison with boreholebased estimates but that is for a separate paper i think my suggestion would be to stick with one of these options i a single example reconstruction ii a plot of a cloud of reconstructions iii a plot of the envelope containing the cloud of reconstructions perhaps also the envelope would encompass their uncertainty estimates but without showing the individual reconstruction best guesses how many votes for each cheers tim'

__label__1 b'excerpts from politico playbook breakfast conversation with rnc chairman reince priebus by mike allen 05062016 0538 pm edt rnc chairman reince priebus was interviewed as part of the playbook breakfast series in washington dc on may 6 mike allen were going to start with a gift to the guest which weve never done before in your profile with cnn which was done before tuesday they asked you how you were feeling about how the primaries were going and you said well im not exactly pouring baileys in my cereal so thanks to my colleague daniel lippman kevin robillard a little present a bottle of baileys for you mr chairman reince priebus oh excellent now wheres the lucky charms and the bowl mike allen your job now is to elect donald trump president of the united states that makes you feel how reince priebus weve said all along that whoever our nominee is were obviously here to support the nominee i think that were as prepared as weve ever been i tell you what if we had the rnc of today four years ago i think mitt romney would be president weve gone from a committee that was in disarray to a committee thats raised over 75 million more dollars than dnc just this cycle hundreds and thousands of people out in the field 5000 people going through 6 weeks of training and a 100 million makeover in our data operation so were prepared to keep the senate keep the house and win the white house and if you look at hillary clinton look i would rather take a few elbows being thrown than the director of the fbi interviewing your top aides and potentially the democrat nominee mike allen tell us what happened when you decided and you tweeted that donald trump was the presumptive nominee reince priebus i had thoughtheard some rumors about the potential of ted cruz dropping out in the afternoon i didnt go out of my way to confirm any of it or make any phone calls because you know sometimes there are times you actually dont want to be in the information loop on things like that because once youre in the loop then if something leaks youre one of the people in the loop so i went to the fundraiser and sure enough the cell phone starts buzzingyou know a few buzzes is one thing but when you get like 15 in a row and you dont want to look down at your phone when youre talking to people and you pick it up and you realize okay i guess the rumor was true went back to the house in kenosha which i hadnt been to in a very long time which was nice and that was it and made some phone calls obviously talked to donald trump a couple of times i think he did a nice job and very gracious in his speech that night and i think we need obviously more of that i think being presidential 30000 feet gracious im hoping that were going to see more of that mike allen does crooked hillary count as presidential reince priebus i think hes done an effective job of labeling and look i think she does have a history of being crooked i think that shes got a lot to answer for i think that shes got families of dead heroes in benghazi to answer for shes got a tenure as secretary of state to answer for i think shes got a lot of material for us to cling on to and use mike allen whats he like behind the scenes reince priebus far more gracious and personable than i think you see at rallies ive never had a problem behind the scenes ive never had a situation where something was said by him that wasnt followed through so all of my interactions have been extremely positive which made the system rigged stuff you know so out of place for me compared to what was being said personally behind the scenes reince priebus i think hes said it himself that theres going to be a time to shift to general election mode and i think thats the way he sees it i think thats the way he feels about it that now the general election is starting and what you saw on tuesday night i think is going to be more of what you see in the future and really the person you saw on tuesday night was the person that i got used to dealing with on the telephone and in person so that general election approach is the type of approach ive been dealing with for six years mike allen is there any way that in cleveland the rules could be used to nominate someone other than donald trump reince priebus my personal view is its highly highly doubtful as i said before the rules committee of 2016 writes the rules for the convention i dont write the rules and in fact the rncs role at the convention is fairly limited and i know weve been through this now for months together walking through our rules but the rnc is basically a caretaker an administrator of the convention mike allen so i hear you saying its unlikely but not impossible reince priebus well nothing is impossible but itlike i said ive said this many times highlyand i add another onehighly unlikely mike allen senator ben sasse of nebraska one of your rising stars had a facebook post and tweet storm two nights ago calling for a draft of an adult conservative challenger to trump and he preloaded it with hashtags wecandobetter and giveusmorechoices is there any danger of a third party run from the right reince priebus i dont believe so i think that the amount of time energy money and also its a guarantee to elect hillary clinton and i think when people start to take a breath and let some of this stuff calm down i think that people are going to understand that the supreme court is too important to let differences of opinions and choices in our primary to get in the way mike allen but the republicans that i talked to say that theres no way to guarantee what thedonald trump will nominate conservatives to the court reince priebus well thats why i think that a smart thing for donald trump to do would be to release five to ten names of people that he would pool from to say heres ten folks that i think would make great supreme court justices and work with people to come up with that list i think things like that would be helpful in kind of recalibrating some peoples minds as far as okay what is this about why do we need to support the republican nomineewhich i think were going to get there mike allen now after speaker ryan made his comment that he was not ready to support donald trump to jake tapper on cnns the lead how quickly did donald trump call you reince priebus well i had talked to him already once that day but i had talked to donald trump and paul ryan multiple times yesterday afternoon mike allen but donald trump called you within minutes reince priebus uhhlaughteryoure pretty good mike allen okay what was his mood reince priebus you know it wasnt like furious or anything its just like what do i need to do i mean imand iso i said listen let me justmy view is just relax and be gracious and ill talk to paul and well try to work on this i know paul really well and i know hes being honest and i know how he feels and so im comfortable with the idea that its going to take some time and some cases for people to work through differences mike allen joe scarborough said on morning joe yesterday that for him to vote for donald trump trump would have to change some of his positions or at least some of his emphasis including the idea of restricting the entry of muslims or forced deportation do you sense that with speaker ryan who youre very close to that it also will take some change in position reince priebus first of all im in agreement on the deporton the ban coming in i mean i put a statement out on that already that its not something that i believe in or our party believes in i believe our party is the party of the open door our party is the party of opportunity and freedom and equality and it always will remain such so there are some things i dont agree with mike allen do you hope to persuade donald trump that the republican party should be the party of the open door reince priebus yeah and i think he believes thati am going to work very hard on making sure that some of these issues are discussed and talked about and understood and im confident that given my experience so far with him that hes going to have an open mind to some of these issues mike allen mitt romney said last night when he announced that he wouldnt support donald trump he said i see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle do you agree theres way too much demagoguery and populism reince priebus i think theres plenty of it now whether theres too much of it i think is a result of what people have been served up in this country and people feel cheated people feel like theyre not bringing enough money home they feel like government hasnt been doing its job or too big in many cases so i think that you sometimes get the result that you build and i think thats sort of what happened across the country mike allen so during the primaries whats the biggest thing that you learned about republican base primary voters reince priebus something that people dont report on a lot which is there is an incredible enthusiasm out there in our party i mean we have record turnout 70 percent higher among republicans 30 percent lower among democrats we have an advantage over voter registration in battleground states that we havent seen in 25 years in the first quarter of this year at the rnc we raised more money than ever in any first quarter in the history of the rnc so we were raising more money in the first quarter than we raised in 2012 mike allen whats the biggest thing you learned about the press during the primaries reince priebus that theres so much of it and theres so many people and a lot of talented people online traditional that almost nothing breaks through so if you have a really good story that youre really proud of and you think that youve done a great job its very difficult for you all to break through because theres just so much i also believe that in too many cases its all about clickbait in many cases im not that worried about the copy im worried about the headline because a lot of times the headline doesnt match the reality i mean you take this group of articles about the rnc meeting in april all of you that wrote articles about how theres going to be a rules fight that eruptsi think you just owe everyone an apologize because its ridiculous theres no rules fight it was 54to2 and so its that kind of stuff where youre just like bog down organizations with clickbait and people have to answer for things that are inaccurate mike allen do you agree with donald trump that beating hillary clinton will be easy reince priebus well i didnt know he said that i dont think anyone would have predicted that trump in this fashion would have you know taken out 16 other candidates he certainly defied the odds and i would say thatfirst of all i personally dont think its going to be easy because i think raising the money building the ground game having the data targeting voters the truth is our party is a great midterm party but weve had a real hard time winning presidential elections and its nothing new the last time weve won with relative ease was 1988 and so i think its a difficult task but i think were up to it and i think that we havewe have a big upside too so i know that there are perils but i also know that theres an upside mike allen the night of the indiana primary abc political director rick klein posted analysis headline donald trump completes takeover of weary republican party do you agree this is donald trumps party reince priebus no its the partys party the party is was and will remain the republican party of the open door freedom opportunity and equality and our platform remainsi believe our platform will remain much the same as it is right now mike allen donald trump repeatedly said as you mentioned earlier that the gop nominating process is rigged i guess it worked out pretty well for him but as we look ahead do there need to be changes reince priebus i have my preferences but it really doesnt matter what matters is that the states themselves adopt their own delegate rules the rules committee at the convention will look at all of this and make recommendations as to how to be better the changes we made to the rules over the twoyear period that we had an opportunity at the rnc were at the time were historic changes i mean the idea of making states that have caucuses or beauty contests tie the allocation to those contests was a big change you saw the ames straw poll is no more why well because candidates were going to ames spending tons of money and getting nothing out of it but they had to go and we said if youre going to do these things you better tie delegates to it there are things that we need to do to improve the debate processwere not going to have a calendar that no one can count on where one week goes by and then you have an abc debate and then ten days later were going to be in myrtle beach and no one knows whats going on were going to have a set calendar and were going to have some say on who the moderators are i mean were not going to have chris matthews conducting the republican party debate and now whats going to happen is four and eight years from now the partys going to have even more control id actually like to see one day if its possible i know theres fec problems but for the party to actually own the rights of the nomination process one day thats going to happen both parties are going to own the rights and they willthey will have media outlets hook into thejust like the nfl does mike allen so you said its like the nfl so you would charge for access to the nominating process reince priebus no just on the debates i mean the point is should media outlets be making tens of millions of dollars on a product that the parties should ownthe nomination process i think should go to the benefit of both parties not the benefit of the media mike allen in december 2012 you commissioned the growth and opportunity project which was called an honest review of the 2012 election cycle what is the biggest recommendation of that report that has been achieved reince priebus getting data buying consumer data census data melding it over to voter file and then putting in an application thats easy for field staff to use the other big change is and it sounds very basic but it is actually important is that were a yearround party now i mean we used to be a party that would accumulate cash in a bucket and you know so youd have 50 million cash on hand and then the nominee would walk in in may or june and youd say okay heres the money now lets go spend it all were spending a ton of money too and thats the difference deciding that were not going to be a party that shows up three months before november what the democrats do is they actually build their operation around the nominee around the candidate so it was barack obama that built the 100 million data system in chicago it was barack obama that never let the field staff off the ground in ohio and florida but what hillary clinton has now going is something that she never expected she didnt want to spend millions of dollars in new york and millions of dollars in indiana and now millions of dollars in california so instead of worrying about voter registration in florida theyre worrying about how in the world are we going to put this thing away mike allen on page 4 of the growth and opportunity project it says many minorities wrongly think that republicans do not want them or want them in the country how do you scale that perception with what donald trump has been saying reince priebus if youre not there mechanically in the community with people from the community trying to talk about our party talk about school choice talk about sba loans for business ownersif someones not there nothing is going to change you also need to have the tonepeople believe obviously you like them if people dont think you like them then theyre not going to vote for you mike allen do hispanics think that donald trump likes them reince priebus i think theres work to do and i think that theres work on tone to do ive been clear about that i think he gets iti think youre going to see the change in tone were in hispanic and black communities every day and you saw the numbers in 2014 now granted thats a midterm but cory gardner got 46 percent of the hispanic vote in colorado we spent 7 8 million on the ground in colorado john kasich got 28 percent of the black vote in ohio if romney would have just gotten 10 percent he would have won ohio so were talking about longterm commitment to hispanic black communities asian communities every community in between and a fulltime yearround party that trump understands that its important for us to do that work mike allen you saw yesterday that donald trump tweeted a picture of himself digging into a tortilla bowl a big dollop of sour cream in it reince priebus i didnt see it i heard about it so i had otheryou can imagine i had other things to deal with yesterday afternoon mike allen anyway the tweet says happy cincodemayo the best taco bowls are made in trump tower grill i love hispanics reince priebus hes trying laughter honestly hes trying and i tell you what i honestly think he understands that building and unifying and growing the party is the only way were going to win and i think he gets that mike allen what are your plans for the convention reince priebus theres a lot of things that are already done i mean the stage is done there are things that just have to happen we moved the convention up seven weeks to july certainly when we were talking about an open convention it seemed like i was a genius for doing that but now we just have to get cruising and get going i think weve done a great job at the rnc i think that when it comes to a competent national party i dont think anyone in this room can say that this national committee isnt the best mechanically rounded competent committee that weve ever had i think having our convention in cleveland is going to pay off big dividends to winning ohio because i think people there even if theyre independent and democrats i think they understand what weve done for the city of cleveland by going to cleveland and putting them in the spotlight mike allen in an interview with the washington post last month donald trump said its very important to put some showbiz into a convention otherwise people are going to fall asleep do you agree the convention should have more of a showbiz feel reince priebus i like the idea of having more of a fun convention if its showbiz if its entertainment whatever the case may be i like that idea but with every suggestion comes millions of dollars in money so the suggestions are great but there has to be you know a pretty big influx of cash to do something like that mike allen both presidents bush jeb bush senator john mccain illinois governor bruce rauner senator mark kirk of illinois senator richard burr of north carolina they all say theyre not coming to the convention senator kelly ayotte in a tough race in new hampshire says it unlikely do you worry about so many of your key leaders sitting it out reince priebus many of these people didnt come to the last two conventions and so i think you have to kind of look at it that way you have to look at people incycle if theyre incycle most of the time theyre not coming to the convention i mean just off the top of my head you asking that i dont think claire mccaskill went to the convention that was four years ago mike allen democrats are licking their chops about the possibility of a blowout one republican said to me donald trump is either going to win 48 states or lose 44 states do you sometimes feel that way reince priebus you know i dont i think this is going to be a really close election i think they will be i think people are divided youve seen the last couple of elections have been close even though the electoral college looks different i think its going to be tight and were going to do everything we can to make sure that we win i think sometimes in our party we get criticized because we dont hit hard enough you know we didnt talk about bill ayers we didnt talk about some of the things that happened in barack obamas life during 2008 i dont think donald trump is going to have a hard time bringing out some of the things that are going to be very not good for hillary clinton mike allen what other states could trump win that romney didnt reince priebus i think he can win ohio i think he can win florida i think he can win pennsylvania i think he can win iowa i think he could put michigan and minnesota in play mike allen you were elected rnc chair in 2011 you were reelected in 2013 reelected 2015 are you going for a fourpeat reince priebus ill figure that out after november but highly doubtful to view online link to change your alert

__label__1 b'dear all here are a few more comments on alpipmod ideas are probably not very well ordered first you should try for a 3 year project and second although here for most of the next three months apart from odd days i probably couldnt justify a meeting i am intending on resubmitting another proposal to the october eu round this one will involve some of the group from advice its aim will be to develop a daily mslp dataset for europe and the atlantic 3070n by 70w50e after the dataset is produced in the first year the second and third year will see various analyses performed and comparisons of several gcm runs performed at the hadley centre this new project will probably go to 241 which will be a different area from yours which will be 214 thus i would hope that your proposal could be developed over email the above dataset would go back to 1850 this is the period which from the improve project is just beyond how far we think we can reliably go back with daily data several papers from the improve poject moberg et al 2000 in jgr and several others in press in a special issue of climatic change have come to the about 1870 date we have much earlier data for the 8 sites but ensuring strict homogeneity of the daily series seems doubtful for some types of extreme measures prior to about 1870 pressure seems better than temperature some sites are better than others monthly is fine for all all the improve and advice data can be used by the alpipmod project i have a summer student updating the 51 monthly mslp sites from advice amongst other things as for your ideas i think you need some overarching theme the atlas and cd of all the data may be one but it also needs to address some scientific issues which can be shown to have relevance to the public i like the idea of making use of the alpine orography looking at changes in lapse rates and the use of high and low elevation air pressures the latter is a totally independent method of looking at the warming and can be used back to the late 18th century the alps have the longest records of any mountaineous records of any region of the world also i am a strong advocate of changes in the influence of features such as the nao and other circulation indicators on surface climate you can clearly look at these changes over the last 200 years with all the data you have another important issue to a lot of climatologists is the relative surface warming compared to the msu2lt data in the lower troposphere although this is hemispheric in extent we can look with the longer alpine records as to changes in lower level lapse rates over 200 years related to this tropical ice caps are disappearing at alarming rates in peru tanzania and in tibet lonnie thompsons work lonnie has calculated that the ice cap on kilimanjaro will not be there by 2015 at its present rate of retreat lonnie has some local temperature series for about 40 years which show a small warming yet the ice caps are going fast why these ice caps have all been cored and have ice during the mwp times yet some arent producing layers now my idea is to use the better known histories of the alpine glaciers to see if they are also melting at accelerated rates than simple temperature averages would imply keith mentioned the forward modelling approaches to determine positions in the past and then relate these to moraine termini do these models still function in the last 20 years lonnie thinks a lot of the tropical melting is due to sublimation which isnt accounted for by the degree day models the elevational sunshine records may be important here and with temperature a particular season may be much more important than the other three all the above is just ideas but getting all the data together instrumental and tree ring as well glacier termini and mass balance allows us to be able to model the glaciers better than anywhere else all europeans will be interested in whether alpine glaciers are going to disappear and there will be clear impacts on biodiversity at the high elevations and tourism another impact area is on the use of glacier meltwater and runoff in hydropower generation these are all good issues to use in the social and economic pages that need to be written cheers phil'

__label__1 b'tom just got the science attachments for the von storch et al paper for tim and keith so i thought you might like to see them ive just sent a reply to von storch as he claims his model is a better representation of reality than mbh how a model that is only given past forcing histories can be better than some proxy data is beyond me but hans seems to believe this the era40 report and jgr paper are relevant here era40 is not of climate quality there are differences and trends with cru data before the late 1970s and again around the mid1960s that should include other variables that are calculated it is so bad in the antarctic that era40 rejects most of the surface obs because they get little weight and they dont begin to get accepted until the late 1970s conclusion is that you cant consider era40 for climate purposes maybe the next generation with a considerable efforts in getting all the missing back data in and changes to weights given to surface data might mean the 3rd generation is better i shouldnt rabbit on about this as i have to go home to drive with ruth to gatwick for our week in florence a lot of people criticise mbh and other papers mike has been involved in but how many people read them fully or just read bits like the attached the attached is a complete distortion of the facts mm are completely wrong in virtually everything they say or do i have sent them countless data series that were used in the jonesmann reviews of geophysics papers i got scant thanks from them for doing this only an email saying i had some of the data series wrong associated with the wrong yeardecade i wasted a few hours checking what id done and got no thanks for pointing their mistake out to them if you think mm are correct and believable then go to this web site 1linklambertcgibinblog it will take a while to get around these web pages and youve got to be a bit of nerd and know the jargon but it lists all the mistakes mckittrick has made in various papers i bet there isnt a link to this on his web site the final attachment is a comment on a truly awful paper by mckittirck and michaels i cant find the original but its reference is in this the paper didnt consider spatial autocorrelation at all fortunately a longer version of the paper did get rejected by ijc it seems a few papers are rejected point im trying to make is you cannot trust anything that mm write mbh is as good a way of putting all the data together as others we get similar results in the work in the holocene in 1998 jones et al and so does tom crowley in a paper in 1999 keiths reconstruction is strikingly similar in his paper from jgr in 2001 mikes may have slightly less variability on decadal scales than the others especially cf esper et al but he is using a lot more data than the others i reckon they are all biased a little to the summer and none are truly annual i say all this in the reviews of geophysics paper bottom line their is no way the mwp whenever it was was as warm globally as the last 20 years there is also no way a whole decade in the lia period was more than 1 deg c on a global basis cooler than the 196190 mean this is all gut feeling no science but years of experience of dealing with global scales and varaibility must got to florence now back in nov 1 cheers phil'

__label__1 b'xflowed dear tom in the end i decided to test the significance of trends in the ot minus mt difference time series as you and john lanzante have suggested i still think that this difference series test is more appropriate when one is operating on a pair of time series with correlated variability for example if you wished to test whether an observed tropical t2lt trend was significantly different from the t2lt trend simulated in an amip experiment but you and john convinced me that our response to douglass et al would be strengthened by using several different approaches to address the statistical significance of differences between modeled and observed temperature trends the tables given below show the results from two different types of test youve already seen the type1 or paired trend results these involve bo and bm which represent any single pair of observed and modeled trends with standard errors sbo and sbm which are adjusted for temporal autocorrelation effects as in our previous work and as in related work by john lanzante we define the normalized trend difference d as d1 bo bm sqrt sbo2 sbm2 under the assumption that d1 is normally distributed values of d1 196 or 196 indicate observedminusmodel trend differences that are significant at the 5 level and one can easily calculate a pvalue for each value of d these pvalues for the 98 pairs of trend tests 49 involving uah data and 49 involving rss data are what we use for determining the total number of hits or rejections of the null hypothesis of no significant difference between modeled and observed trends i note that each test is twotailed since we have no information a priori about the direction of the model trend ie whether we expect the simulated trend to be significantly larger or smaller than observed the type2 results are the difference series tests these involve ot and mt which represent any single pair of modeled and observed layeraveraged temperature time series one first defines the difference time series dt ot mt and then calculates the trend bd in dt and its adjusted standard error sbd the test statistic is then simply d2 bd sbd as in the case of the paired trend tests we assume that d2 is normally distributed and then calculate pvalues for the 98 pairs of difference series tests as i mentioned in a previous email the interpretation of the difference series tests is a little complicated over half 35 of the 49 model simulations examined in the ccsp report include some form of volcanic forcing in these 35 cases differencing the ot and mt time series reduces the amplitude of this externallyforced component in dt this will tend to reduce the overall temporal variability of dt and hence reduce sbd the standard error of the trend in dt such noise reduction should make it easier to identify true differences in the anthropogenicallyforced components of bo and bd but since the internallygenerated variability in ot and mt is uncorrelated differencing ot and mt has the opposite effect of amplifying the noise thus inflating sbd and making it more difficult to identify modelversusobserved trend differences the results given below show that the paired trend and difference series tests yield very similar rejection rates of the null hypothesis the bottom line is that regardless of which test we use which significance level we stipulate which observational dataset we use or which atmospheric layer we focus on there is no evidence to support douglass et als assertion that all uah and rss satellite trends are inconsistent with model results rejection rates for stipulated 5 significance level test type no of tests t2 hits t2lt hits 1 obsvsmodel type1 49 x 2 98 2 204 1 102 2 obsvsmodel type2 49 x 2 98 2 204 2 204 rejection rates for stipulated 10 significance level test type no of tests t2 hits t2lt hits 1 obsvsmodel type1 49 x 2 98 4 408 2 204 2 obsvsmodel type2 49 x 2 98 3 306 3 306 rejection rates for

its a little tricky to figure out the null distribution of rejection rates ie the distribution that might be expected by chance alone my gut feeling is that this is easiest to do by generating distributions of the d1 and d2 statistics using model control run data only use of monte carlo procedures gets into issues of whether one should use block resampling and attempt to preserve the characteristic decorrelation times of the model and observational data being tested etc etc thanks very much to all of you for your advice and comments i still believe that there is considerable merit in a brief response to douglass et al i think this could be done relatively quickly from my perspective this response should highlight four issues 1 it should identify the flaws in the statistical approach used by douglass et al to compare modeled and observed trends 2 it should do the significance testing properly and report on the results of paired trend and difference series tests 3 it should show something similar to the figure that leo recently distributed ie zonalmean trend profiles in various versions of the raobcore data and highlight the fact that the structural uncertainty in sondebased estimates of tropospheric temperature change is much larger than was claimed in douglass et al 4 it should note and discuss the considerable body of complementary evidence supporting the finding that the tropical lower troposphere has warmed over the satellite era with best regards ben'

__label__1 b'hi coauthors here are some thoughts on what to say on climate sensitivity in our chapter this is an attempt to focus on the main simple messages for policy makers i think we should try retaining those important messages and not lose sight of them amidst all the details complexity and caveats the main policyrelevant question could be phrased as follows does the past climate history tell us how sensitive the climate system is to co2 i submit that the answers to this we get from different time periods are the following deep time reconstructions are too uncertain and boundary conditions too different eg continents in different places different ocean circulation to draw quantitative conclusions about sensitivity to co2 but there is clear evidence that times of high co2 in earth history tend to be ice free royer et al 2004 a second piece of evidence is the late paleocene thermal maximum which shows that the climate has responded by warming to a large carbon release into the atmosphere just how large this carbon release was is not known since several origins of the carbon are possible which have different isotope signature and would thus imply different amounts but the temperature response was large 6k and if anything this response would point to a high sensitivity glacialinterglacial changes we have by now sufficiently good quantitative reconstructions of co2 and other forcings as well as temperatures in order to derive useful quantitative estimates of climate sensitivity lgm was the most recent time in history in which co2 concentration differed greatly from preindustrial values by as much as it does now it is the closest test case for response to co2 changes that we have there are two basic methods to derive climate sensitivity i based on data analysis eg lorius et al 1991 concluding sensitivity is 34 k this method has the caveat that this sensitivity applies to colder climate which may differ somewhat from that which applies in present climate as the strength of feedbacks is expected to depend on the mean climate eg stronger snowalbedo feedback in colder conditions ii based on combining data and models eg schneider von deimling et al 2004 does not have the above caveat but depends on models lag of co2 behind temperature does not imply a lack of co2 effect on climate since the lag is small centuries not millennia holocene last millennium overall conclusions qualitatively climate history is at least consistent with the accepted co2 sensitivity there is no evidence for much lower or much higher co2 sensitivity note that co2 is not the only forcing the more recent climate history as far back as ice core data go does allow quantitative inferences the results of these estimates all lie within the ipcc range and provide strong support for this paleodata may even allow to reduce this range since at least one study argues that values above 4k are very likely inconsistent with the reconstructed lgm climate for high co2 sensitivity tropical cooling in the glacial should have been larger cheers stefan'

summary this research will make a major contribution to our knowledge of highresolution climate variability at high latitudes of western and middle siberia throughout the holocene using the unique potential of treering data the specific objectives of this proposal are the development of two supralong each spanning 69000 years up to present continuous larch ringwidth chronologies at two distant each other highlatitude locations of siberia yamal and taimyr peninsulas ringwidth chronologies developed from coniferous trees growing at the polar timberline in siberia contain a very strong climatic signal mainly summer air temperatures with these chronologies highresolution continuous and quantitative reconstruction of summer temperatures will be made as in the areas of the past and present polar and upper timberlines trees megafossils have been preserved properly in large quantities in the holocene deposits alluvial lacustrine and peat there is a good possibility to develop continuous multimillennial treering chronologies now the material already collected and measured 1800 subfossil wood samples from yamal and 280 samples from taimyr has yielded the ringwidth chronologies continuously spanning the last 3200 years yamal and 950 years taimyr however there are also many more samples that have been measured and have provided data now assembled in a number of provisionally floating chronologies covering much of the period from 7000 to 1700 bc based on some 70 radiocarbon dates of samples of this wood there is a fair chance that a 69000year continuous chronologies will be constructed within the span of the proposed project these chronologies and temperature reconstructions will be the first to be so long reliable annuallyresolved and preciselydated with known reliability across the whole of northern hemisphere these reconstructions will allow to compare and contrast the details of temperature changes at the moderatecontinental region of yamal peninsula with the continental region of taimyr peninsula and allow modern and predicted temperature patterns to be compared with variability patterns of preindustrial era participants of the proposed project are the wellknown institutions which are engaged in the field of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology and have collaborated with each other during the last 6 years fajl workprotxt 31 title multimillenniallength dendroclimatic reconstructions at highlatitude regions of siberia 32 objectives this research will make a major contribution to our knoweledge of highresolution climate variability at high latitudes of western and middle siberia throughout the holocene using the unique potential of treering data the specific objectives of this proposal are as follows to develop two supralong each spanning 69000 years up to present continuous ringwidth larch chronologies at two highlatitude locations of siberia using these treering chronologies tomake a multimillennial highresolution continuous and quantitative reconstruction of summer temperatures to analyse spatiotemporal patterns of temperature variability at these locations over a range of timescales annual decadal multidecadal and centennial and their connections with various forcing factors and other annual resolution records being developed elsewhere in the arctic and subarctic 33 background reconstruction and analysis of natural climatic changes through the whole holocene at high latitudes are of great importance as climatic conditions especially air temperature are most variable and sensitive to various forcing functions budyko 1980 jones and kelly 1983 intergovernmental panel on climate change 1990 however there are a minute quantity of long preciselydated and highresolution proxy climatic series for these regions the territory of yamal peninsula located on the eastern boundary of influence of the atlantic air masses and the territory of the eastern part of taimyr peninsula located between the arctic high and siberian high are of major importance for monitoring regional and globalmean air temperatures and assessing theories and models concerned with past current and future climate changes lamb 1977 briffa and jones 1993 moses et al 1987 tree rings as a proxy indicator of the past climatic conditions are of special interest as they allow to reconstruct climatic parameters with seasonal and annual resolution for many hundred and thousand years to provide an exact absolute and relative dating of the treering data to establish highfrequency climate changes from interannual to centennial timescales with high confidence to obtain dendroclimatic information practically for every site where trees grow at present or grew in the past intensive dendroclimatic investigations are carrying out in many countries and regions mainly in temperate and subtropic zones fritts 1976 1991 at high latitudes such works began later during the last two decades and living trees were used primarily for developing treering chronologies of 200500 years long aniol and eckstein 1984 shiyatov 1984 1986 jacoby and darrigo 1989 schweingruber briffa and nogler 1993 briffa jones schweingruber shiyatov and vaganov1996 jacoby wiles darrigo 1996 vaganov shiyatov and mazepa 1996 as in the areas of the past and present polar and upper timberlines trees megafossils have been preserved properly in large quantities on the surface and in the holocene deposits alluvial lacustrine and peat there is a possibility to develop continuous multimillennium and sensitive to climate treering chronologies such works began in the polar ural mountains shiyatov 1986 graybill and shiyatov 1992 briffa jones schweingruber shiyatov and cook 1995 in the southern part of yamal peninsula shiyatov surkov 1980 hantemirov 1995 in finnish lapland and northern sweden zetterberg eronen and briffa 1995 in the eastern part of taimyr peninsula vaganov naurazbaev schweingruber and briffa in press and in the lower indigirka river at present now the longest continuous and absolutedated ringwidth chronologies developed for the yamal peninsula spanning 3200 years and for the northern scandinavia spanning 2160 years and the floating chronologies dated by the radiocarbon method extended back 9500 and over 7000 years respectively ringwidth chronologies developed from coniferous trees growing at the polar timberline in moderatecontinental and continental regions of siberia contain a very strong climatic signal mainly summer air temperatures of tree growth year graybill and shiyatov 1992 briffa jones schweingruber shiyatov and cook 1995 hantemirov 1995 vaganov shiyatov and mazepa 1996the explained variance over the calibration and verification periods is highest reported in the literature to date 6570 and it allows to make a quantitative reconstructions of summer temperatures these chronologies and temperature reconstructions will be the first to be so long reliable annuallyresolved and preciselydated with known reliability across the whole of northern hemisphere these reconstructions will allow to compare and contrast the details of temperature changes at the moderatecontinental region of yamal peninsula with the continental region of taimyr peninsula and allow modern and predicted temperature patterns to be compared with variability patterns of preindustrial era participants of the proposed project are the wellknown institutions which are engaged in the field of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology and have collaborated with each other during the last 6 years the group of treering and site of the swiss federal institute for forest snow and landscape research birmensdorf switzerland the group is currently engaged on a major programme of densitometric and ringwidth chronology development involving many sites across the whole of the northern hemisphere including sites with living trees in the polar timberline area of russia this work is specifically designed to provide climaticallysensitive data for use in large spatial climate reconstruction work dr fhschweingruber head of the group is known throughout the world for his work in wood anatomy and dendrochronology and the development of treering densitometry he has published extensively in different areas of wood anatomy and treegrowth research and has authored several classic books the laboratory of dendrochronology of the institute of plant and animal ecology of the russian academy of sciences ekaterinburg russia is one of the leading laboratory in the field of dendrochronology in russia the laboratory has an international reputation for its work on the developing ringwidth chronologies at high latitudes and altitudes reconstruction of climatic conditions developing longterm chronologies studying cycles in treering series using treering data for studies of the upper and polar timberlines dynamics and forest succession dr sgshiyatov head of the laboratory is one of the pioneers of dendrochronology in russia and has worked for more than 30 years in the far north and mountains of the urals siberia far east and middle asia he has published more than 130 articles and three monographs dr shiyatov was the first who began to collect subfossil wood in russia for developing longterm chronologies the laboratory of dendrochronology of the institute of forest of the russian academy of sciences krasnoyarsk russia is another leading laboratory in the field of dendrochronology in russia dr eavaganov director of the institute of forest and head of the laboratory of dendrochronology has an international reputation for his work on the cell structure of wood lyers of coniferous trees seasonal growth variations and cambium activity developing simulation models of seasonal tree growth developing ringwidth and cell chronologies reconstructing climatic conditions of the past using treering chronologies he has published more than 100 articles and 5 monographs the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia norwich great britain is one of the worlds leading research organisation specialising in the study of climate change climate history current climates projected changes and impacts dr krbriffa senior research associate at the climatic research unit has considerable experience in climatology and with the use of statistical methods of climate analyses and dendroclimatic reconstruction especially with regard to largespatialscale reconstructions of climate patterns and published many articles on the theoretical and practical aspects of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology and on use of paleoclimate data for understanding current and possible future climates 34 scientific and technical description 341 research activities treering data will be obtained from living trees and subfossil wood of siberian larch larix sibirica ledeb in western siberia and gmelini larch larix gmelini pilger in central siberia the first location is situated in the southern part of yamal peninsula 67688n 69718e the second location in the eastern part of taimyr peninsula 71738n 981058e there is a great many properly preserved subfossil wood in the holocene deposits at both locations mainly in the alluvial and peat deposits the main variable measured will be ring width this variable reflects properly climate influences on tree growth at the polar timberline areas of siberia having a continental climate ringwidth chronologies for the last 400500 years will be developed from the oldest living trees extensions to these chronologies back further in time will be made by using subfossil material joined with the living material by standard crossdating procedures highprecision radiocarbon dates will be used for rough dating of floating treering chronologies the sampling subfossil wood and development of the yamals supralong chronology began since 1982 by the workers of the laboratory of dendrochronology ekaterinburg most intensively this work was carried out during the last five years now the material already collected and measured 1800 subfossil wood cuts has yielded the ringwidth chronology continuously spanning the last 3200 years however there are also many more samples that have been measured and have provided data now assembled in a number of provisionally floating chronologies covering much of the period from 7000 to 1700 bc based on some 45 radiocarbon dates of samples of this wood these chronologies separated by 50 to 500 year length gaps there is a fair chance that a 9000year continuous chronology will be constructed for this location within the span of the proposed project similarly work with a shorter history than the yamals research has clearly established potential to build a chronology at least as long in the taimyr peninsula where the modern polar timberline extends to about 72830n most northern over the world this work is not so advanced as in yamal but the work to date suggests that very rapid progress is likely samples from living and dead trees have already been assembled at the laboratory of dendrochronology krasnoyarsk into the 950year continuous chronology the collections from this location are not so extensive as those made to date at yamal 280 subfossil wood samples but there is an abundant supply of subfossil trees many with over 300 annual rings 25 radiocarbon dates of samples of this material suggest major phases of tree growth around 8500 bp and 5000 bp the general distribution of the radiocarbon dates suggests that eventually sufficient trees can probably be located to span the whole of the last 10000 years it is not expected that a continuous 10000year ringwidth chronology will be produced within timeframe of this project however there are good prospects of producing a 56000 year chronology to the present 342 research results during three years we expect to develop the continuous and goodreplicated treering 9000year larch chronology for the yamal peninsula and the 56000year larch chronology for the taimyr peninsula using these chronologies we intend to reconstruct and analyse a summer temperature variation at several time scales annual decadal multidecadal and centennial and compare the data obtained with other highresolution holocenelength proxy data ice cores laminated sediments historical documents the results of this project will be published primarily in the scientific literature in russian and english and presented at different national and international conferences because of the fundamental interdisciplinarity and collaborative interaction within the subgroups a number of multiauthored papers will be produced the individual and mean ringwidth chronologies and the reconstructions produced will be distributed to the international scientific community through submission to the international treering data bank boulder colorado usa and to other national and international institutions and data centres 35 management information 351 task division dr fhschweingruber swiss federal institute for forest snow and landscape research will be the project coordinator on the proposed project from the intas countries dr sgshiyatov institute of plant and animal ecology will be the responsible scientist on the proposed project and he will take part in

wood during summers of 19971998 at two highlatitude locations yamal and taimyr peninsulas using helicopters boats and ships to finish the development of the yamal chronology it is necessary to collect additionally no less than 300400 cuts of subfossil wood much more intensive collecting 600800 cuts for two field seasons is needed to develop the taimyr chronology all samples collected during these two years and earlier will be measured and crossdated at ekaterinburg and krasnoyarsk laboratories until the middle of 1999 the russian laboratories together with the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia during 19971999 will be analysing the material obtained standardization of individual series development of mean chronologies studying growthclimate relationships developing statistical models of tree growth extracting climatic signal reconstructing and analysing climatic conditions of the remote past this work will be finished at the end of 1999 353 equipment

__label__1 b'eystein we have now heard that millennium will definitely be funded this means that the very worst case scenario has been realised because it means that the eu are not likely to call for any palaeoclimate in the next funding round i have to say that though there is normally an element of randomness in the refereeing of eu proposals that to a large extent is unfortunate but inevitable i believe strongly that the system has let us down very badly in this case it is clear that we the imprint community were misled first by ib troens direction given publicly in utrecht that we should produce a proposal which was of the scale to unify the whole palaeoclimate community with a specific role to bring data and modelling foci to bear on the issue of climate predictability that we should be careful to not to overemphasise the collection of new data but rather work mostly to consolidate and jointly interpret existing data and that we should formulate a scheme where these are fed directly into a hierarchy of modelling experiments that would address causes of climate change model viability and issues of probability of future climate and its causes secondly we were misled by the accepting on the basis of the published call that the eu required ip proposals of ambitious scope large enough to move the science of european palaeoclimate forward as a whole and with relevance to globally important issues with aims clearly beyond the scope of slightly bigger streps on reading the cursory referees responses to our proposal i am also moved to express my own opinion that they are an insult to the community of researchers that constitute imprint and an indictment of the failure of the referees to address their assessment to the generally publicised aims of the ip concept to describe the whole proposal as too complicated and to state that there is no value in the first four workpackages and most of all to rate the quality of the consortium as 4 out of 5 all require explicit justification well beyond the few lines with which we are presented while i have no ill will at all regarding the competing proposal millennium i feel that the extended imprint community can justifiably ask very serious questions regarding the apparent lack of equitable assessment of the two proposals in the light of the published call requirements the efforts of the imprint consortium over recent months at least deserve answers as to how for the sake of 05 of a mark that proposal will be funded when it clearly did not address the scope of the original call in terms of community integration emphasis on wider data consolidation scope of model hierarchy and specific addressing of the datamodel integration towards the issue of climate sensitivitypredictability expressing these concerns should not be considered sour grapes they are not and i congratulate the millennium team on having succeeded they will do valuable research rather these comments are justified because the review process has not taken account of the scope of the ip concept and the need to invoke a research plan with the necessary breadth and expertise and proven managerial ability as can be gauged by the assessment of the carbo ocean coordination plan and because the success of the much more limited millennium project has already been cited by european officials as justification for the lack of any need to fund palaeoclimate research in the next call effectively cutting off the wider palaeoclimate community from eu research support for the next few years i believe we are justified in questioning the operation of the ip concept and questioning it in fora beyond the circle of eu administration which has in my opinion has done a serious disservice to our community and palaeoclimate in general at the very least the goalposts regarding ip proposals seem to have been moved and the time of many researchers has been wasted please feel free to forward this message to the rest of our group'

__label__1 b'mike here are some of the issues as i see them saying it is natural variability is not an explanation what are the physical processes where did the heat go we know there is a build up of ocean heat prior to el nino and a discharge and sfc t warming during late stages of el nino but is the observing system sufficient to track it quite aside from the changes in the ocean we know there are major changes in the storm tracks and teleconnections with enso and there is a lot more rain on land during la nina more drought in el nino so how does the albedo change overall changes in cloud at the very least the extra rain on land means a lot more heat goes into evaporation rather than raising temperatures and so that keeps land temps down and should generate cloud but the resulting evaporative cooling means the heat goes into atmosphere and should be radiated to space so we should be able to track it with ceres data the ceres data are unfortunately wonting and so too are the cloud data the ocean data are also lacking although some of that may be related to the ocean current changes and burying heat at depth where it is not picked up if it is sequestered at depth then it comes back to haunt us later and so we should know about it kevin'

__label__1 b'hi grant i have been tied up with other things in looking at the paper some questions 1 in fig 1 why is the scale zero to 2 normally a filter would be scaled to have a response function zero to 1 2 in fig 2 and 3 what are the units of power it is not in the caption are these normalized spectra so that the area under the curve is unity my guess is that this is the case and hence the amplification at enso bands but it is important to say this and perhaps point out maybe the captions are sufficient add something like the spectra have been normalized to have unit variance which relatively inflates the values in the 02 to 05 frequency band in a couple of places in text add normalized before power spectrum such as 2 lines above fig 3 in the jgr set version 3 a minor point in the x sin2pivt i would be inclined to add an amplitude which would then be included also in eq 1 on rhs emphasizing how the amplitude is changed my own preference would be to call the amplitude a and the a you have r for response function however it is fine as is thanks kevin'

__label__1 b'hi phil glad i can help even if quite indirectly i know what you mean about the need for community when under duress the individual quality of being a scientist works against us in this way attached are the original letter and the official ucar response i dont know what the lawyers might have written other than their input to the official response letter i do know they sought information from caspar and myself but less so i dont recall if we made available to them our correspondance with steve schneider about our responses to the review of wa that mcintyre did which had a lot of information in it that debunked his claims about withholding contrary results etc etc in fact we have never mentioned this to steve to make sure that he was in the situation to make editorial decisions as focused soley on the science as possible i was wondering if there is any way we as the scientific community can seek some kind of cease and desist action with these people they are making all kinds of claims all over the community and we act in relatively disempowered ways note that ucar did send the response letter to the presidents of the two academic institutions with which mm are associated although this seems to have had no impact seeking the help of the attorneys you speak about would be useful i should think i know that mike has said he looked into slander action with the attorneys with whom he spoke but they said it is hard to do since mike is in effect a public person and to do so would take a lot of his time assuming that the legal time could somewhow be supported financially if i might ask if you do get legal advice could you inquire into the possibility of acting proactively in response via the british system maybe the public person situation does not hold there or less so i only ask you to consider this question on my part obviously please do what you deem best for your situation finally i have shared the mm letter and ucar response before only with one other scientist a now retired emminent person here in the us whom i asked to look over all the materials and give me his frank opinion if he felt we had done anything inappropriate he came back with a solid no and said that what mm were attempting was unspeakable caspar has mentioned that ucar said to him they did not want to disseminate these materials publically and i have kept to that other than the case mentioned it seems clear to me that providing them to you is appropriate i have not contacted caspar to think about it at this point and dont feel i need to anyway this is just to give you the context on that side of things i would imagine that sharing the docs with legal persons you trust would be ok note that i am now out of contact through july 9 i wish you all the best peace gene'

__label__1 b'dear mike et al i offer the following comments on your letter for your consideration it seems to me there are 2 primary issues to address a what does proxy evidence say about whether the medieval warm period was global b what do we know about potential mechanisms for the medieval warm period i evidence for a forced phenomenon ii evidence for internal variability issue a is currently dealt with in your sections 1 and 2 one point that could be perhaps conveyed more clearly is the necessity of using the spatial information conveyed in multi proxy reconstructions rather than overly interpreting sets of local proxy evidence i felt this point could have been stressed more and is one which the casual reader may not appreciate issue b bi is in your section 3 i suggest a more explicit mention of conclusions with regard to the medieval warm period in recent work on this topic the first statement in this section doesnt provide i dont think explicit evidence to back itself up the sentence starting these results could be more explicit about what those studies show with respect to the medieval warm period in addition to the more general statement about the partitionng between forced and internal variability a reader could ask ok if 50 of the variability is explained by volcanic and solar forcing that doesnt exclude the other 50 playing a strong role for events such as the medieval warming such a question could be dealt with in advance by stating what role these studies suggest for radiative forcing in the medieval warm period for issue bii i would suggest being explicit that it is incumbent upon authors to provide some evidence to support their speculation what evidence can the author provide to support his speculation concerning the role of the thc in the medieval warm period rather than explicitly stating this is not a likely mechanism i would contrast the speculation he has offered on this topic to the stronger in my opinion evidence provided by modeling studies to support the idea of the importance of radiative forcing a few more minor comments 1 i agree with the overall message you are conveying but might choose somewhat differing wording in a place or two the statement is made 1 it cannot reasonably be argued that the middle ages were as warm as the 20th century at global or hemispheric scales this might be a bit strong i would think one can have a reasoned discussion on this topic perhaps something like we strongly disagree with the assertion that the middle ages were as warm as the 20th century at global or hemispheric scales 2 in the second to last sentence i would add the qualifying phrase on planetary scales after the text responsible for centennialmillenial changes regards tom delworth ps the central issue is one that i have not been heavily involved in and thus dont think its appropriate for me to sign on as an author good luck and please send me a copy of your final submission pps i previously provided to tom correlations between the thc and globalhemispheric temperature based on a 900 year run of our r30 coupled model these correlations were relatively low 027 but probably significant the applicability of those correlations to the issue of the medieval warming may not be strong if the medieval warming is a multicentury event then i should really be looking at the correlations of low frequency 50 years filtered model output from a run of several millenia duration thus the 900 year run may not be applicable i will revisit this topic using a multimillenial r15 coupled run but probably wont have any results today i dont think that would change the essential conclusions however i recall that experiments with the r15 model in which the thc was substantially weakened through the addition of fresh water to the north atlantic provided strong regional temperature anomalies but their global expression was small these experiments are being repeated with the higher resolution model in light of these issues i suggest that the focus be not so much on saying the thc cannot be responsible for the medieval warming but rather on saying 1 there is strong evidence for a substantial role of radiative forcing and 2 the burden is on the author to provide evidence for the role of the thc'

__label__1 b'\xef\xbb\xbf due to the ongoing debate this has turned an even more difficult manuscript in general i think martin did a very good job in the review of the literature concerning the new reconstructions and the evaluation of mcintyre work i would not fully agree with some of the conclusions which i thin do not follow from the material presented in the text i have some remarks on this which you may consider useful but i think that i am not the one that should give the manuscript the final shape as martin is the person in charge of the project please consider the following comments as suggestions eduardo consensus i would tend to avoid the word consensus since it is not a well defined concept depending on the meaning of consensus each would agree with it to a certain degree i would prefer to refer to a particular ipcc conclusion or something similar i think this review of the literature is very well written and informative but i am not sure that each one of us will agree with each one of the concussions of each of the papers page 12 section 28 i think the text is somewhat vague here and it could be misunderstood mann et al 2005 tested the regem method not the original mbh98 method it is true that applied to the real proxies both methods according to mann yield very similar results but strictly speaking mann did not test the mbh98 method in the csm simulation the mbh98 method is thereby only by implication i tested the the sensitivity of the mbh98 and not of regem to the length of the calibration period it may be the regem is less sensitive or not at all figure 4 and 5 if i understood well support this dependency of mbh to the calibration period am i correct to interpret the large differences between the original mbh reconstruction dashed red and the black curve as due to the different calibration period 19011980 versus 18561980 and to the use of the leading pc or nht as calibration target at least in the period prior to 1600 i think these are the only methodological differences between both curves my interpretation of this figure is also somewhat different if the final reconstructions differs so strongly by using a longer calibration period in general yielding stronger decadal variability in the reconstruction i would tend to think that the method based on these proxies is quite unstable what would happen if the calibration period could have been extended to 1800 for instance page 15 top the role of forcing on the global or nh t is also recognized in the correlation between the nht simulated by echog and csm for the millennium for the case of a second echog simulation gonzalezrouco et al the agreement is very close at 30year timescale section 3 beginning in my opinion mm05 stress the inadequacies and uncertainties in the mbh work but they not put forward their own reconstruction implying a warmerthantoday mwp they believe that this is true but in their works so far at least to my knowledge they do not assert that the mwp was warmer than present only that the uncertainties are too large for such a claim section 3 consensus this paragraph may be problematic again what is the consensus if we look at the recent nas report which again not every one would agree with the consensus is reduced to the past 400 years in comparison to ipcc leaving ample space for speculation before this period does the nas report belong to the consensus perhaps partially but i am not sure to what extent section 3 discussion of mm05 and hockeystick index i have here a certain level of disagreement with these paragraphs the issue raised by mm05 would be that the decentering of the proxies prior to the calculations of the principal components tends to produce hockeystickshaped leading pc i think this effect is true at least with spatially uncorrelated rednoise series it can be easily verified and it has been recognized in the nas the wegman report and by francis zwiers to be fair following this issue is the problem of the truncation just to keep the leading pc or further pcs down the hiercharchy and if this is done the final differences could be probably minor in the final reconstructions but the paragraph implies in my opinion that this criticism by mm05 has no grounds which as i said is problematic and could open the manuscript with criticisms based on these recent reports i think that the calculation shown in figure 3 is very useful as it boils down to the issue raised by mm05 how relevant is the decentering and standardization with real proxies apparently i get a different message from figure3 although i may have misinterpreted the text i see quite large differences in the 20th century between the original mbh leading pc and the correct calculation whole period centering and standarizationblue line only the original mbh pc shows a positive trend in the 20th century the blue lines seems even to show a negative trend or no trend at all if this pcs were to be used in the mbh regression model with trend included in the calibration the results could be quite different i would tend to think that this figure actually supports the mm05 criticism since the hockeystick shape of the leading pc disappears section 3 end bristlecone pines i am also worried by this paragraph the recent nas report clearly states that the bristlecone pines should not be used for reconstructions in view of their potential problems they cite previous analysis on this issue i think that to refer to just one study indicating no fertilization effect could not be enough however i am not a dendroclimatologist this could open the door to potential problems section 4 end years 1997 and onwards were the warmest in the millennium i see here also potential problems with this claim and i do not see the need to make our lives more complicated the nas report expressed that the uncertainties are too large for this type of conclusion and certainly this conclusion would attract some attention from the reader i see two lines of criticism on this one is that the standard errors have been calculated with the calibration residuals and these are an underestimation of the true uncertainties a reviewer may require that the uncertainty range be calculated by crosscalibration or bootstraping in the case of cvm perhaps this effect is not very important as there is just one free parameter but in the case of inverse regression there are much many more free parameters and the true uncertainties can be quite different from those estimated from the calibration residuals this potential criticism could be exacerbated by the fact that the new reconstruction has not been tested in a validation period the other line of criticism could be that the calibration period has been as in all reconstructions a priori truncated data after 1980 are not considered as the proxies are known to not follow the temperature strictly speaking this truncation can be only justified by a credible physical explanation about the cause of this divergence statistically i think it is not correct to a priori ignore some data because they do not fit if one does so i think the uncertainty range should be enlarged to encompass the possibility that this divergence could have happened in the past ie an additional standard deviation of the instrumental nh t in the period 19802000 or perhaps more correct the square root of the sum of the error variance and the nht variance in 19802000 alternatively one could include the period 19802000 in the calibration and due to the divergence the standard errors would grow but perhaps this is practically not possible as the proxy time series may not have been archived for the last 20 years section 5 conclusions i share the worry of anders moberg about the wording serious flaws in the analysis of mm05 this sentence would be based on figure 3 if i understood properly but as i said i think figures 3 actually does not support this conclusion finally i think it would strategically better to avoid conflicts on the particular point of whether some particular year was the warmest of the millennium or not and to stress the fact that all reconstructions also the new ones presented in the manuscript with one exception show mwp temperatures lower than late 20th century temperatures another conclusion could be in my view that the average temperature in the cold centuries in the millennium seems to be still quite uncertain the new reconstructions or the calculation of the leading pcs of the proxies seem to be still quite sensitive to particular choices in the statistical setup'

the newspaper had a front page story the following monday and a whole page of pictures inside i confessed i did not attend the rally immigration reform is a serious issue but this event was organized by a man who identified himself as a sympathizer with the national socialist movement whenever i want to learn more about immigration reform i avoid listening t o members of that movement i don92t know what they could add to the discussion the herald92s account one that i can now view as a reader of the paper searching for the truth reported confrontations between people estimated the crowd at 100 people and displayed pictures showing people pointing fingers faces contorted mouths open and handmade signs obviously the herald thought the immigration reform rally organized by a selfavowed national socialist movement member was important enough to meri t the extensive coverage the other news coverage that caused me to take pause was a headline 93chas e subject in freeborn county jail94 the headline said it all i didn92t have to read the story when deputie s must chase a prisoner in the nearly new freeborn county jail it92s the en d of civilization as i know it i just hope the mower county commissioners saw that story too and are taking steps to insure that won92t happen in our new county jail there are hundreds of offenders waiting to move into the new facility being built in downtown austin once they92re in jail prisoners should stay in their airconditioned cells watching cable tv reading girlie magazines calling friends on cell phones smuggled into the jail on visiting day surfing the internet for new facebook friends or waiting for a trip to the dentist eye clinic or hospital to have a doctor take a look at that back ache suffered crawling out a window during a burglary attempt there should be no need to chase subjects in jail enjoying the accommodations provided by taxpayers and don92t get me started about seeing that woman92s obituary photo next to the young couple92s engagement photo the other day putting an obituary n ext to an engagement is 85 awkward to say the least i also read chicago suntimes columnist neil steinberg92s july 6 effort headlined 93hamming it up at spam museum94 the columnist began by recounting his visit to johnny92s main event restaurant and the less than satisfactory experience next he crossed north main street

uttered by a lifesized video of a fatigueclad soldier94 the columnist writes a less than flattering account of visiting what is to austin a sacred place in closing he suggests he received a lackluster sales job on other local attractions and claimed the museum staff suggested he could stay at a holiday inn in austin or 93wellington94 minn wellington never heard of the place there92s plenty to read

0854 am pdt on thursday july 30 2009 by john asbury the pressenterprise fueled by anger over the economy immigration and the election of president barack obama white supremacists have been increasing in number in the inland region and throughout california during the past year local and national experts say the southern poverty law center which tracks hate activity reports 84 known hate groups in california the no 2 state texas has 66 about a dozen of those groups are in the inland area including riverside hemet san bernardino and temecula according to the center in the past year a new chapter of the national socialist movement a sec t of the largest neonazi group in the country started in riverside according to riverside county sheriffs investigators and the antidefamation league the group has not been tied to criminal activity in the inland area authorities say story continues below link cli ck to enlargelink jpg if you look at the election of the first black president and the state of the economy being what it is today with unemployment at an alltime high these types of things are kind of a perfect storm for these feelings to foment and for white supremacists to feel validated said joanna mendelson california investigative researcher for the antidefamation league a civil rights advocacy group in addition to concerns about membership going up inland agencies are seeing a few of the groups become more sophisticated and violent developin g criminal organizations that dont just target minorities but are also branching into drugs and weapons trafficking those activities are easier t o conceal in remote regions like some parts of the inland area said mendelso n and inland authorities statistics on hate crimes committed and charges filed remain limited the most recent state attorney generals office report was based on crimes committed in 2007 but inland police and sheriffs investigators and national experts point to a number of factors including recent violent attacks and a rise in hate propaganda online as evidence that hate activity is on the rise here local law enforcement agencies are stepping up efforts to monitor hate groups such as racist skinhead organizations which commonly adopt aryan or newnazi beliefs and target people of certain races and religions the goal is to put violent offenders in prison and stop criminal groups before they gain too much power for example seven members of a hemet skinhead group have been arrested in the november beating of a hispanic man described by hemet police as backlash against obamas election san bernardino county authorities say they dismantled a large skinhead organization this year that they suspect was involved in multiple murders and assaults in addition to the skinhead and neonazi groups on the southern poverty law centers list of inland southern california hate groups the center include s a border security organization an antigay religious group and a black separatist group which may be deemed intolerant but are not linked to crim e or violence brian levin director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at cal state san bernardino said he believes the inland area has the largest number of hate groups in the united states when you look at the sheer number of groups in the inland empire to begin with it is significant he said breeding ground law enforcement officials say the inland area follows the pattern of other areas on the outskirts of larger cities where hate groups pop up amid a white flight migration out of cities and suburbs that have become more developed and diverse southern california is a prime location for recruiting of white supremacis t gang members hemet police detective bob nishida said theyre looking fo r the type of people with neonazi beliefs and for this area generally speaking theres a lot of people with those same beliefs though most of californias skinheads are not affiliated with any groups the inland area is an exception since the election weve seen an increased drive for groups to unite unde r one flag said san bernardino county sheriffs deputy eric ogaz in remote regions such as the high desert skinhead groups are more frequently holding unityfests joint meetings between different organizations to merge forces and have the potential to plan criminal activity he said authorities see such rallies as an effort to become more violent and instill fear into the community it makes more sense for them to act as a unit ogaz said theres a greater fight in a dog working in the sense of a pack this spring san bernardino county sheriffs deputies arrested seven member s of the inland empire skins the suspects were accused of an october home invasion robbery and attempted murder in hesperia and conspiracy to commit murder of a witness in san jacinto the group based in san bernardino and hesperia originated in 2002 its members often have tattoos of swastikas and other symbols of hate against blacks hispanics and homosexuals san bernardino county sheriff rod hoops said the department suspects the group is responsible for numerous murders and assaults the sheriffs department also has linked the group to gun trafficking to and from riverside county while the inland empire skins primarily target minorities ogaz said the october home invasion and attempted murder case targeted another skinhead who was selling drugs the organization is a traditional sect of skinheads where members believe in remaining drugfree to keep their blood pure and they will go after anyone known to be using or selling drugs ogaz said the same day the suspects were arrested april 20 two women in the gang ha d arranged to give birth because it would have been adolf hitlers 120th birthday ogaz said motivations for hate while black people remain the most frequent target of white supremacists experts say hatred of hispanic immigrants is perhaps their fastestgrowing motivation both locally and nationally what weve been seeing is the growth driven by antiimmigrant propaganda said mark potok director of intelligence projects for the southern poverty law center the economic downturn also has played a role in drawing people to white supremacist groups mendelson said two main scapegoats are hispanic immigrants who are blamed for taking jobs and jews blamed for the bankin g collapse she said the riverside county district attorneys office classifies racist skinhead organizations into two categories those traditionally focused on political ideology and those that commit crimes more like a street gang there do seem to be more skinhead gangs with prison ties moving into the inland empire said nikolaus peterson a riverside county deputy district attorney theyre not as motivated by hate as much as criminal control and dealing drugs other skinheads are opposed to racism and criminal activity he said you cant paint every shaved head with the same brush peterson said hollie schrack 24 of big bear city is a member of coors family skins which stands for comrades of our racial struggle she said her racialist beliefs are not about hating others but about loving people of her own heritage other groups are allotted to have a significant amount of pride and venues to idealize pride for their heritage she said its sad were not allowed to be proud of being white schrack said she doesnt consider herself a white supremacist or superior t o other races but she does discourage interracial relationships hemet police took notice of the coors gang last year following an august stabbing of another white supremacist who did not want to join the gang nishida said schrack denies race played a factor in a beating that police say coors members committed a hispanic man was beaten into a coma in hemet in november four members ar e charged with attacking the man while screaming white power according to hemet police coors members contend they were defending themselves after the man broke into one of their cars on the groups web site which schrack took down after the arrests the organization professed we hate with pure virtuous hatred anything or anyone that threatens our way of life or attempts to stand in the way of ou r racial preservation cracking down local law enforcement has begun trying to crack down on many of the white supremacist groups suspected of violent crimes and drugtrade involvement both the riverside and san bernardino county sheriffs departments have gan g task forces that track the white supremacists in addition to other street gangs the hemet valley gang task force has joined with the riverside county sheriffs department and district attorneys office to add white supremacis t groups to their gangprevention program gang officers are attempting to reach teens and their families to steer them away from violence said nishida since the coors arrests the gang has been dormant nishida said it hasnt gone away they seem to always come back he said theres a high chance they probably will other than imprisoning group leaders and violent members authorities say little can be done to stop hate groups from forming or to change their ideologies if one group is dismantled oftentimes more quickly form still inland law enforcement agents say they are trying to stop the groups from gaining momentum by enforcement against smaller crimes the intention is that tracking groups and making arrests will prevent larger conspiracies from being carried out theres no such thing as a minor crime ogaz said if we dont treat these aggressively small crimes could fester and create communitywide tension'

poised to have more power than ever he has millions of followers now is a nationwide name and a bill cosponsorship will carry with it more cache than ever but theres a catch senate democrats are watching how he handles the end of primary season and an uproarious nevada convention closely it depends on how he handles the national convention in philadelphia and how he handles the next months said sen jeanne shaheen dnh who says she was heckled for the first time in her life by sanders supporters during the new hampshire primary i appreciate that hes going to continue to stay defiant but the fact is hillary clintons going to win the nomination is he going to support her and campaign for her or is he going to help elect donald trump asked whether the discord at the nevada convention could spill into the halls of the senate sen jon tester dmont said it absolutely could defiant senator sanderss statement on the events in nevada which included people throwing chairs shouting down sen barbara boxer and threatening the state party chair was defiant concentrating more on how the party has wronged him than the allegations that his supporters are stoking violence yet there are signs that privately sanders is trying to quell concerns among his colleagues he personally dialed up boxer on tuesday and she said it was a warm conversation that convinced her that he understood why she felt threatened in las vegas now most of sanderss democratic colleagues want to hear something public from him to that effect to feel better about the party coming together said sen barbara mikulski im perplexed because the bernie that i know always has stood for the highest principles of nonviolent behavior advocacy of gandhi and dr king i would like for him to live up to his own principles and standards what happened in nevada was beyond disturbing my story this am link ripple effect in nevada sanders asked supporters to donate to lucy floress congressional campaign april

going to be no its me rubio says of writing his own tweets to a much larger audience than ever before 13 million people and yes theres a realization that the public likes hearing from rubio not his staff he said maybe he should have done his own social media during the presidential campaign im in the middle of running for office so you cant just stand around all day and send stuff out but you know maybe i should have maybe it would be worked out different a grinning rubio said in an interview sources close to the twitter account while he said his late night rant about unnamed sources speaking on his half was done for fun he really was pretty angry about what was being spread about him anonymously the one that really bothered me was when someone close to me said that i hated the senate ive never said those words to anyone it started a narrative but its just not accurate i have members of my staff that work really hard imagine youre a staff member and you read that and you think my gosh im working for someone that hates his job thats just not true rubio did so hes back to doing his own tweets after the campaign is he ready to embrace hiphop again every senator has to draw a line i wouldnt say none of it rubio said when asked if he listen to any of the new stuff i migrated toward the electronic stuff because usually it doesnt have lyrics so i dont have to worry about the kids hearing it fair actual rubio news hes hired washington power lawyer bob barnett to help him find postsenate employment intrepid miami reporter marc caputo writes this morning senator

__label__1 b'dear colleagues you may already know it the eu fp5 second call for proposals is out since today link as expected and the deadline for submission is feb 15 the new call does indeed answer a question i have been wondering about when i heard from many firstcall projects that they were asked to resubmit the present call is only for the slots that were last year declared to be opened at this stage not for the previous slots probably the reinvited proposals then still bid for the old money or at least i hope so there is however one important exception 231 mitigation and adaptation to global change about this the official document says reopen because of the quality of proposal received in reply to the call of 20 march 1999 further down they point out that kyoto really is tremendously important for the commission primary objective and then comes the following farreaching sentence if one takes into account the time lag between the research results the political decisions and the actual emission reduction it is evident that the year 2000 is the last opportunity for research to cover the remaining analytical gaps of priority dapg2en199902pdf page 6 tough this mail goes to all people i have currently listed as likely participants in ateam although the group may either grow or shrink as the remaining time passes by depending among other things on your inputs the present state of development is that i have recently circulated another draft of our basic document among just a few of you hoping for input to it really soon on the basis of this i intend to a develop a better draft that will then be circulated to all of you b organize a small brainstorming meeting hopefully before christmas but again only with a small core group c by christmas provide you with a roadmap for the remaining things to be done best regards wolfgang wolfgang cramer department of global change and natural systems potsdam institute for climate impact research po box 60 12 03 d14412 potsdam germany tel 493312882521 fax 493312882600 mailtowolfgangcramerpikpotsdamde'

__label__1 b'hi all im betting that provisional acceptance is not good enough for inclusion in the second order draft but based on what gene has said he should have formal acceptance soon we really need that can you give us a read on when youll have it gene best make this a top priority or well have to leave your important work out of the chapter many thanks peck hi peck i assume a provisional acceptance is ok by ipcc rules the timing of these matters are being followed closely by mcintyre see link and we cannot afford to being caught doing anything that is not within the regulations thus need to consult with martin and susan on this see also last mail from melinda cheers eystein thanks gene it is worth all the effort and please keep us especially keith posted on the updates best peck xsieve cmu sieve 22 subject re wahlammann paper on mbhmm issues date thu 19 jan 2006 211703 0500 threadtopic wahlammann paper on mbhmm issues threadindex acwbf2jtf69xjlfkthuhzzu6qk8tmxkoajub28ng2a from wahl eugene r userdomaincom to jonathan overpeck userdomaincom hello jonathan and keith im not sure that i ever sent you the updated wahlammann paper that was the basis for steves provisional acceptance here it is as is it contains a long appendix 1 on issues with interannual statistics of merit for validation which was not in the version i had sent you earlier in the year all the main results and conclusions are the same caspar and i are also now responding to steves final requests based on independent rereview this is primarily to address publishing pearsons r2 and ce calculations for verification which steve and the reviewer reason should be done to get the conversation off the topic of us choosing not to report these measures and onto the science itself we explain thoroughly in the appendix i mention above why we feel these and other interannualonly measures of merit are not of much use for verification in the mbh context so that the fact we are reporting them is contextualized appropriately in fact we will be going farther than that and will be bringing this material currently in an appendix into the main text based on the reasoning belowquoted from another message caspar mentioned yesterday that he talked with susan solomon about this paper and she did not see the appendix we had added concerning the issues about pearsons r2 etc based on this she therefore thought our text was weak in this area in relation to mcintyres criticisms caspar thought and i agree that we need to bring this stuff out of the appendix and get it into the methods section so that it wont be so easily missed we are working on thiswhich will include other material as well in the text proper also we are going ahead with an even furtherexpanded discussion on the issues with r2 which itself will probably become an appendix in the final text it had been slated for publication as supplemental website material this expanded discussion will go into additional reasoning with graphics concerning the basis for r2 not being useful in this context it will give a vector space analysis of the issues and explicit visual demonstration of how these issues with r2 play out in terms of false negative and false positive errors in validation let me know if i can be of any further help in all this apologies if this message seems long i did my best to keep it short but im a bit tired and it is hard to edit well in that state peace gene dr eugene r wahl asst professor of environmental studies alfred university 1 saxon drive alfred ny 14802 6078712604'

__label__1 b'janice most of the data series in most of the plots have just appeared on the cru web site go to data then to paleoclimate did this to stop getting hassled by the skeptics for the data series mike mann refuses to talk to these people and i can understand why they are just trying to find if weve done anything wrong i sent one of them loads of series and he barely said a thankyou it seems they are now going for tom crowley lonnie thompson and gordon jacoby as most of their series are not on web sites below is a link to an awful piece by legates he told me he is a writing a paper but wrote the press release first the pdf is worth getting for a couple of sentences when he said that mj restricted their use of paleo series to those that had correlations with instrumental data it is a classic our uncertainty estimates are based solely on how well the proxy records match the observed data the legates piece must have been sent to loads of environment correspondents across the world and a number of oped pieces appeared some were awful most have had responses from ray bradley caspar amman and others hope all is well with you and all the best to all glad you enjoyed the paper cheers phil ps do you want to get involved in ipcc this time im the cla of the atmospheric obs chapter with kevin trenberth and well be looking for contributing authors to help the lead authors we have paleo is in a different section this time led by peck and eystein janssen keith is a lead author as well phil jones has made a valid point in that some of the articles cited in my critique do not directly address problems with mann and jones mj but rather address problems with earlier works by mann bradley and hughes mbh and other colleagues fair enough i have changed the critique to reflect that fact the revised version has been posted since july 19 at 1link however i still contend that most of my original arguments namely the problems with the shaft blade and sheath apply equally to mann and jones as well as the other mann et al manifestations of the hockey stick mj incorporate data from a number of the same sources as those used by mbh for example manns unpublished pc1 from the western north american treering data cooks tasmanian tree rings thompsons quelccaya and dunde ice core oxygen isotope records the latter embedded in yangs chinese composite and fishers stacked greenland ice core oxygen isotope record calibration and verification of mj includes the flawed mbh curve thus any errors in mbh effectively undermine the calibrationverification results of mj leaving this study unsupported and any problems with the underlying common proxies identified in critiques of mbh will also result in identical problems in mj my criticism regarding the blade is that 06 deg c warming for the last century is noted by the ipcc whereas mj and other m et al representations have up to 095 deg c warming in their observed record see mjs figure 2 where for the global and nh reconstruction their estimates for 2000 exceed 04 and 05 nearly 06 respectively mjs nh curve is included in the attached graph thus i stand by my criticism of mj on this point which is more egregious in mj than other m et al representations from jones the trend over the 20th century in the figure and in the instrumental data ipcc quotes 06 deg c over the 19012000 period fact but legates is eyeballing the curve to get 095 deg c a figure isnt given in mann and jones 2003 take it from me the trend is about the same as the instrumental record funny but there is a figure in mj see their figure 2 as for me eyeballing an apparently nonexistent curve i attach a figure from soon et al 2004 that contains a portion of mjs figure 2 to allow others to decide for themselves whether mj suggest a twentieth century warming of 06 deg c or 095 deg c moreover maybe someone can explain why every time mann and his colleagues draft another curve the temperature in 2000 gets warmer and warmer after the fact my criticisms regarding the sheath largely from a paper on which i am working stem from the characterization of the uncertainty by mj that arises solely from the fit statistics to the 16001855 period using crossvalidation with not observations but composites of three previously compiled reconstructions including that developed by mbh the focus of known flaws and errors in the shaft note that some of the same data are used in both mbh and mj which doesnt allow for a truly independent crossvalidation my rather obvious point was not that fit statistics should not be included as jones asserts but that mj included no errors in either input realization observations or proxy data or other obvious sources of error the claim by mbh and mj is that only the model lackoffit contributes to uncertainty is inherently flawed considerable errors exist in the representation of both fields annual temperatures from both observations and proxy records and must be incorporated clearly there is a spatial bias associated with observations that are biased away from the oceans high latitudes and high altitudes the spatial problem is far more pronounced when only a handful of proxies are used to represent the global temperatures at earlier time periods both mbh and mj are equally guilty in this regard david r legates'
__label__1 b'hi again peck sorry forgot about the raw volcanic series originally i had it as a separate panel yes yet another panel but then i tried underlaying it on the smoothed series in a pale grey please see attached files pdf and gif of the modelforcing figure what do you think is it too distracting to have these grey spikes also note that they are on the same scale as the rest of the forcings and unfortunately some spikes are truncated at the bottom of the forcings panel especially 1259 event this particular series ive used is from ammann and you can see the link between the spikes and the smoothed greencolour volcanic curve finally note that this is just panels ad if you like this version then you can insert it into the word file i sent before in place of panels ad use the gif file for this purpose youll see that panel e is a separate piece of figure and can stay unchanged in the word file hope you follow this bit ps keith hasnt seen this version not sure what his views are on the distraction of the grey spikes must go now tim'

__label__1 b'xflowed hi all including eystein whom i havent been able to talk with on these issues yet 1 id like to get your status report on fig 612 based on feedback from henry pollack we will keep the borehole curves and corresponding instrumental data i believe we are also going to add the new recon from law dome valerie was going to send do you have everything needed for this figure revision 2 since we met in bergen i have received feedback from many about our mwp box and would like to float the idea that we delete the bottom osborn and briffa panel i know this is shocking coming from me i think ob 2006 is a paper of the year contender but i have become convinced that it will be too much of a lightening rod for what it gives us we still show the data in the top panel which conveys the same thing although in a much less sophisticated way and we still back up with citations to ob2006 but we hopefully avoid a possible intense focus on methodological focus on the fig and the criticism that its la work that hasnt been thoroughly vetted this focus ie from skeptics and those inclined to listen to them for political reasons is stupid but we want to keep readers focused on the science and not on the politicallygenerated flak i think we can do this just as well without the ob06 figure assuming we still cite the findings of the ob06 paper but just dont show the figure we also save space not the reason for my suggestion but a good thing given what keith and tim need to add in response to issue like divergence etc obviously was the biggest fan and pusher for the figure to be included and im sorry to be suggesting otherwise now does this make sense thanks peck'

__label__1 b'hi phil sorry that you have taken such a negative spin from this i had hoped it was all resolved pretty amicably and emphasized to keith and tim that i was being perhaps overly picky this time precisely to avoid the misunderstanding that happened last time around w science trust that im certainly on board w you that were all working towards a common goal that is what is distressing about commentarys yours from last year and potentially without us having had approprimate input keith and tims now that appear to divide and conquer the skeptics happily took your commentary last year as reason to doubt our results in fact your piece was references in several commentaries mostly on the web not published attacking our work so that is what this is all about it is in the name of the common effort were all engaged in that i have voiced concerns about language and details in this latest commentaryso as to avoid precisely that scenario please understand the above to be a complete and honest statement about the source of my concerns it really doesnt have anything to do about who did what first etc i trust that history will give us all proper credit for what were doing here the millennialscale trend issue appears to be a source of contention malcolm can address the replication issue better than any of usits not a problem w our reconstruction furthermore we have explicitly taken into account the loss of lowfrequency variance in our estimates of uncertainty i dont know how many times i need to stress this it is of fundamental importance in framing our conclusions our own analysis convinces me that things are already quite uncertain a millennium back in time with regard to longer timescale variations the evidence is all over the place at egs i saw some convincing evidence that many new paleo proxies indicate steadily decline at least over several millennia and so do in large part the available long borehole estimates though we should all take that w a good dose of nacl so im skeptical of estimates more than a millennium back in time until we have multiple proxies we can trust at that timescale and can verify somehow the dc component of the estimates or at least replicate them this was my concern about the latest 2000 year recon that was shown you are right the milankovitch forcing argument is only a null hypothesis i hope i havent argued anything more than that that our millennial scale trend which we reasonably trust and have some idea of the uncertainties in is in line w that null hypothesis is information that cannot be ignored that kutzbach berger and others are showing increasingly convincing model integrations over several millennia suggesting this is more evidence in the real word anything could have happened but lets not loose site of the appropriate null hypothesis here i hope the above clears things up somewhat im sorry things have been construed in more negative light than i had ever intended call me anytime to discuss here at the office not sure how well our schedules overlap though thanks and sorry for the miscommunication here mike'

accusing democrats of plotting to hold hostage k12 schools by demanding an immediate overhaul to the states school funding system last year schools opened on time despite a budget stalemate because the democraticcontrolled legislature gave rauner a separate education spending plan that he signed he vetoed the rest of the budget this session rauner says democrats are scheming to keep schools from opening in the fall by demanding an immediate education funding formula overhaul that the governor calls a bailout for chicago schools not in madigans playbook but a highlevel democrat close to house

largely played out in the illinois senate the source says madigan believes the strategy of attempting to leverage school openings in order to pass a full state budget is a losing gambit saying it could be viewed as placing the interest of children on equal footing with even the most mundane of spending so whats the most likely legislative budget scenario similar to last year lawmakers are required to put forward a budget and its likely be a democratic plan surprise rauner will have the option to veto it in its entirety as he did in 2015 with the exception of k12 or use reduction veto

__label__1 b'dear dr ritson your email to phil jones suggests that there are serious discrepancies between the echam1lsg power spectrum that i computed for the 1995 barnett et al holocene paper and the echam1lsg power spectrum that curt covey posted on the www this is not the case at the time that tim barnett phil jones keith briffa and i performed the research that is the subject of the holocene paper only 600 years of control run data were available from echam1lsg this is stated on page 256 of the holocene paper the first ca 200250 years of this control integration incorporated a large nonlinear climate drift component this was manifested both in globallyaveraged temperature and in other climate variables see santer et al 1995 jgr 100 1069310725 prior to computing the spectrum i removed the overall ie 600year leastsquares linear trend there is still considerable lowfrequency variance in the residuals in part but not wholly due to the nonlinearity of the drift component in the first few centuries this residual drift explains some portion of the gfdlversusecham1 power discrepancies at timescales of 100 years the cmip project received data from mpi well after the completion of the research described in the barnett et al paper at that time i believe that 1250 years of echam1lsg control run data were made available my understanding is that curt did not use the first driftcontaminated 250 years of the echam1lsg control run when he computed the echam1 spectrum displayed on the cmip www page his analysis relied on the last 1000 years of the data not surprisingly neglecting the first 250 years makes a big difference to the computed spectrum this is particularly apparent at low frequencies and also in the variance ratio between periods of 300 and 2 years that you compute i hope this clarifies things should you still have residual concerns about our method of spectral analysis which is standard and follows jenkins and watts id be happy to provide you with a copy of the program that was used to generate the spectra sincerely ben santer'

__label__1 b'dear colleagues at the hihol meeting in avignon in october several of us steig van ommen dahljensen vimeux agreed to write a review paper addressing holocene climate change as viewed from polar ice core records the main task of writing and organizing this paper has fallen upon tas and eric and we are writing to solicit your interest support and contribution we would appreciate hearing from each of you with comments on our proposed plan requests for clarification and hopefully data sets we hope you will be interested in working with us on this project note that the deadline for completion is the end of march 2001 although the question of holocene climate change has obviously been addressed in numerous papers on individual ice core records and most recently in the masson et al review of antarctic records in qr we believe that it would be valuable to select the bestunderstood best dated polar ice core data from both hemispheres and put them in a single paper we also think that the paper should be limited only to 1 data that address directly the temperature history at high latitudes the information we get from isotopes and from borehole reconstructions as opposed eg to atmospheric circulation changes that one gets from the chemistry record and 2 discussion of the longterm variations as opposed to short term variations such as the little ice age the intention here is not to be exclusive of either people or ideas but to limit the scope of the paper so that it is as definitive a document as possible of particular interest is the simple question of the timing and magnitude of the thermal maximum the subsequent holocene cooling and their relationship to insolation forcing this was a major question at the hihol meeting and we do not believe it was adequately resolved there our vision is a summary paper that not only reproduces alreadypublished work but that carefully quantifies the uncertainties inherent in each of the reconstructions of particular interest are the possible affects of elevation change on the records and uncertainties in the timescales we cannot say a priori what the conclusions of this paper will be an example might be that the thermal maximum was actually warmer than present a major issue of contention in the popular literature and was moreorless simultaneous in both polar regions if this is correct it will be a useful service to the paleoclimate community to demonstrate it alternatively we may find after carefully looking at the data that we cannot reach such a conclusion this would be an equally important result how should we proceed our suggestion is that those who are willing to participate send their favorite icecore based temperature reconstructions to us providing the best available timescales and a brief description of the uncertainties you ascribe to the reconstruction we will compile the data and produce both 1 a single file containing all the data and 2 a pdf figure comparing all the independent temperature reconstructions we can then intitiate discussion around a common figure so that everyone is looking at exactly the same information the last 11000 years would be considered the appropriate time interval to consider we do not wish to confuse matters by including the glacialinterglacial transition data sets that we think would be particularly important include the following note that we will probably need to include other authors this is just a preliminary list and is not intended to exclude anyone we are also aware that some of these data are so far unpublished but we hope that they could be included anyway perhaps in smoothed form 1 isotope profiles from vostok byrd and epica if possible on the mostaccepted timescales francoise 2 isotope profiles from taylor dome and siple dome dye 3 and gisp2 eric 3 isotope profile from dome fuji fujii 3 isotope profiles and borehole temperatures from law dome cores tas vin 4 isotope data from grip and from ngrip if possible dorthe 4 borehole data from taylor dome gisp2 dye 3 gary ed 5 borehole data from grip and ngrip if possible dorethe 6 isotope meltlayer frequency and borehole t data from the canadian ice caps david fritz 7 meltlayer data from other sites gisp2 alley the law and taylor dome records only go to mid holocene but would still be very useful here other suggestions for data sets and people to contact again please reply to this email with your comments criticisms concerns request for clarification and hopefully data sets thanks warm regards to all eric steig tas van ommen'

__label__1 b'hi mike and others i just read the ap release as always there is a bit of journalistic license that was applied to interpreting what i said the opening statement in the release is utterly the words of the reporter some of the quotes are probably accurate but of course do not include qualifiers etc i also talked with this journo before talking with you and would phrase things a bit more carefully now after hearing your concerns so i am not deceiving you in what i told you over the phone i would not express things the same way as you in any case because i do think that we have some legitimate differences of opinion on some issues although i think we agree much more than we disagree be that as it may talking over the phone to journalists in a rapidfire manner is not the best way to convey ideas and information and i would have rephrased or reexpressed some of what was written if i had seen it before it was released this was not an option provided to me i think that it is a bit harse to say that the paper should not have been published while i might wish to change some wording in the paper and express things a bit differently knowing what i know now i dont think that the paper is fatally flawed like you do i should also point out that i have received a number of emails from respected scientists in global change research who do not appear to share your opinion on the other hand i have also received a couple of emails from certified nuts which is what you are obviously most concerned about i am not happy with such people but i have also been savaged by similar nuts like john daly in the past so i guess i cant win finally this whole global change debate totally sucks because it is so politicized it reminds me too much of the ugly acid rainforest decline debate that i was caught in the middle of years ago i am quite happy to leave global change to others in the future ed original message'

__label__1 b'klaus a few belated comments on your 1st draft which is looking promising a we need to be careful about using conceptsterms such as unacceptable global warming as i think richard tol says we do not have any sound basis for determining what constitutes dangerous climate change is it one life lost a nationstate inundated or some more utilitarian exceedance of a benefitcost ratio does every citizen on the planet have a vote or just each government we should draw attention to the rather flimsy basis upon which notions of safe or dangerous tolerable or unacceptable climate change are debated in the end of course there are lots of things we may view as unacceptable war for example yet they happen and we survive i think this is an area rich for research and we could draw out some of the dimensions b later on you use the idea of balancing abatements costs vs the risks of climate change i think we need to use the language of risk here and to draw upon insights developed by risk analysts academic and professionals about how we frame the climate change problem in risk terms the differential perceptions of risks inc climate ones therefore becomes central in addressing point a c the proposed ecf project on changes in extreme weather is of course a necessary first step towards the quantification of climate risks this should be one of the justifications for work in this area it is also the case that better understanding of these changes will yield insights into how adaptation does or should proceed at both environmental systems and institutional systems levels d re nuclear energy in a climate protection portfolio the ecf should be bold and should question and expose assumptions made on both sides of the debate about the up and downsides of this technology it is rising higher on the uk agenda and there will be some challenging times ahead in this country about its rightful place and role i look forward to seeing the second draft mike'

monday about the abrupt resignation of michael melaniphy the american public transportation associations president and ceo the announcement came just a couple weeks after new yorks metropolitan transportation authority announced plans to dump apta and nix their 400000 annual payment laying out their criticisms in a sevenpage breakup letter outlining the groups shortcomings and criticizing the leadership teams deep divisions snubbing of legacy transit agencies and expensive executive salaries among other issues from inside the agency melaniphy whos had aptas top job since 2011 has reportedly experienced increasingly fraught relations with the organizations executive committee over the years a person knowledgeable about internal dynamics at apta told politico that melaniphy had a difficult working relationship with the committee particularly its chair valarie j mccall railwayage quoted a critic complaining about his overthetop showboating at conferences as well as excessive compensation given apta is a publicsector organization and several people with knowledge of the agencys goingson suggested that melaniphys severance will be a number approximating his annual salary a total that hovers around 900000 according to the organizations recent filings with the irs in a statement on monday night apta vice president rosemary sheridan declined to comment on melaniphys severance or his relationship with the executive committee but she said the criticisms raised by the mta would not go ignored and the organization was checking in on its other members the apta board and apta staff leadership are very focused on showing the value of apta membership to all of our members including mta we are listening to our members concerns and are taking them very seriously she wrote as for that damning letter april 8 letter the concerns laid out by the mta were wideranging but excerpts offer a sense of aptas increasing difficulties balancing the interests of members in the public versus private sectors the highlights to have no voting executive committee member from either a legacy property or from a commuter rail carrier is unconscionable other organizations have emerged providing the same services in a more effective and efficient manner based upon aptas lack of responsiveness over the past five years in addressing the serious issues outlined above we have grave concerns that you will address any of them in a meaningful way if your contract is renewed for another five years todays the day the national transportation safety board today will release new details about the cause of last years washington metro lenfant plaza smoke incident as well as recommendations on how to prevent similar incidents in the future wamus martin di caro has some early details the recommendations will go beyond wmata and also extend to agencies including dc fire and emergency medical services the dc mayors office and the federal transit administration illequipped among the recommendations the ntsb will urge the district to address how its 911 call center unnecessarily delayed the response to the trapped train sources said di caro writes an onscene emergency response professional also was not trained and failed to adequately integrate metro personnel into the incident response sources said moreover the ntsb will reiterate its stance that the fta is not

boats sail past the shore no singing mayday any more ht maggie chan business is aboomin airline profits increased more than 300 percent in 2015 a jump from 75 billion for the nations 25 scheduled passenger carriers in 2014 to 256 billion in 2015 as our jennifer scholtes writes of those airlines net income last year 68 billion came from fees for baggageand reservation changes fees for other items and services like upgraded seating assignments and food sales are reported to the department within airlines overall totals rather than broken out like the other two ancillary fees get more on the stats here but as jen points out these record profits come as the justice department investigates allegations that several major us carriers have been colluding to keep ticket prices high whats good for the goose from a4as vaughn jennings airlines are putting every dollar to work for customers employees and investors along with enhancing the customer experience and boosting staffing airlines retired 8 billion of expensive debt in 2015 and returned 105 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends and offered domestic flyers the largest number of seats since the great recession show me the money the american association of airport executives took the statistics as an opportunity to call on airlines to drop their opposition against increasing the cap on airport passenger facility charges which has not been increased since 2000 making the argument that airlines havent done their fair share to support investment and growth at the airports that serve their customers for far too long policymakers have ignored the staggering disconnect from the airline industry said aaae president and ceo todd hauptli which is alltoohappy to collect billions in airlineimposed fees destined for their bottom line but fights with all of its political might to oppose local fees that pay to build airport infrastructure and serve the traveling public putting those tax dollars to good use politicos burgess everett and seung min kim have an update on the senates progress so far this year and the notsoaccurate claims that the upper chamber is working harder than ever though the senate lauds the number of bills passed in recent months the fast act and the faa reauthorization bill among them seung min and burgess explain that the numbers dont support this notion that the senates current stopatnothing industriousness the chamber is on pace to work the fewest days in 60 years the party continues to insist it wont act on president barack obamas supreme court nomination and republicans ballyhooed strategy to shepherd all dozen spending bills through the chamber is in serious trouble they write the level of productivity isnt just about bragging rights senate republicans are staking their push to maintain control of the chamber in november on a message that a donothing senate is a thing of the past successfully prosecuting that case could become even more critical if donald trump who many believe will be a drag on the gop ticket wins the nomination now thats what we call a grind but the gop has opened itself to attack after criticizing democrats for developing a shortened monday through thursday schedule that mcconnell has largely preserved the first thing i need to do is to get the senate back to normal that means working more i dont think weve had any votes on friday in anybodys memory mcconnell said immediately after winning reelection and the senate majority in november 2014 the senate still comes in on monday evening and leaves early thursday afternoon in a typical week theres not been a single friday vote this year putting the brakes on riders the new york times editorial board is weighing in on the 73hour trucking rest rule that has sparked concerns about the thud appropriations process in an editorial published monday the times called this and other budgetary riders stealth attacks and dangerous amendments aimed at satisfying ideological causes and benefiting special interests the rider bars the administration from reinstating the rule unless it can show that it produced a statistically significant improvement in safety and driver health during the brief time it was in place that is a ridiculously high burden to meet if the provision becomes law it will be impossible for the government to issue basic regulations to make sure companies are not putting dangerously tired drivers on the road not to worry schumer says sen chuck schumer dny is insistent that the current plans to build new rail tunnels underneath the hudson river wont be wait for it derailed by political intervention but infrastructure advocates in new york are wary politico new yorks dana rubinstein has a dispatch from a monday breakfast where schumer was asked pointblank whether the socalled gateway project could get killed off by a single elected official such as gov chris christie did a few years ago no butts about it my guess is if you looked inside him he regrets that decision now because he got walloped on it schumer said referring to christie politically the person whose butt is most on the line on this is christie because if this tunnel isnt built and 300000 400000 new jerseyans cant get to work except by ferry waiting on the long lines this governor or any future governor will have a lot to pay christies flack responded that the previous project is nothing like the current one norton remains concerned about csx derailment dc del eleanor holmes norton plans to meet with federal railroad administration officials on wednesday to talk about the freight derailment and hazardous material spill that occurred in northeast washington on sunday morning this derailment is a wakeup call that should teach us about preventing future hazmat rail car derailments norton said in a statement after she visited the site on monday although this derailment happened in an openspace area of the tracks i am particularly concerned if such a derailment had occurred in a tunnel such as the csx virginia avenue tunnel where construction continues updates from the derailment site according to the fra crews on monday successfully rerailed all but one of the derailed cars the last car will be removed by a truck trailer because of 750 gallons of sodium hydroxide leaked into the ground crews will excavate soil at that site and lay down new tracks customers with freight traveling through the area can expect delays between 8 and 24 hours the fra said its not over til its over and now its over

__label__1 b'hi peck et al a little late but id like to put in my twopence worth regarding your original message and phils reply i have been tied up with a load of stuff so dont interpret my lack of speedy response as a lack of interest in these matters my first comment is that i agree with all of your general remarks and with your implied rebuke to phil that we should be very wary of seeming to dam certain proxies and over hype others when we all know that there are real strengths and weaknesses associted with them all the truth is that all of this group are well aware of this and of the associated fact that even within each of these subdisciplines eg dendro coral etc there is a large range of value or concern with the external usage of our data however my own and phils concerns are motivated like yourself by the outside worlds inability to appreciate these points and the danger that we will all be seen as uncritical or niave about the real value of proxy data the rationale for the recent jones et al paper and some things that i have written in the past is to inform would be users particularly the modellers that there are critical questions to be addressed about how the palaeodata are best used in a detection or model validation context many in the palaeocommunity understand these issues but perhaps there has been some reluctance to air them in sufficient depth or in the right situations where they will be heardseen by those people who now seek to use the data i believe that many of the modellers having been blissfully unaware for years of the need to work with the palaeocommunity are now expecting too much this carries the danger of a backlash as they undertake simple assessments of the palaeoseries and conclude that they are all of very little use the problem is that as we try to inform them we may get the balance between valueable self criticism and scientific flagellation wrong the more so when the whip is seemingly aimed at others there is no doubt though that many palaeo types are not concerned with the bigger issues of climate change so it is up to those who do such as this group to try to sort out some sensible approach to how we do explore the good and bad fairly in our collective data and how we present this to the outside world the meeting you propose is a good way forwardif he is already not included i also urge you to invite ed cook i hate cold feet and i dont ski so i vote for anywhere away from snow to answer the question about the degradation in treering chronology confidence back in time yes we that is several of us in tree rings and rising out of them in average temperature or rainfall series have suggested a basis for quantifying chronology error as a function of series replication and timedependent chages in the correlations of the series that go to form the mean chronology the problem is tricky because the error is timescale ie frequency dependent also this is just the chronology calculating confidence limits on reconstructions derived from one or more chronologies must take account of the regression error again likely to be timescale dependent while incorporating the additional uncertainty associated with the chronology when the reconstructions are derived using a spatial transfer function such as in canonical correlation or our similar orthogonal spatial regression technique the reconstruction at each point in the predictand network has some different uncertainty relating to the error in each predictor series and the magnitude of its influence in the specific regression equation relating to that point finally as regards this issue if you have detrended or highpass filtered the original predictor series in some way ie treering standardisation you have some potential longtimescale uncertainty around the final reconstruction which can not be represented by any analyses of the remaining prdictors or their association with a relatively short instrumental predictand series i have a half drafted paper on this which i intended to submit to treering bulletin perhaps one day your question about jasper the sample depth in my opinion is responsible for the early high values so dont put much faith in the early warmth we have devised a simple method of scaling down the variance in average series to take account of the inflated variance that occurs when a reduced number of series are averaged such as at the start of this chronology we used this in our recent nature paper looking at a possible volcanic signal in the density data averaged over the northern network ed has incorporated this in the latest version of his super treering standardisationchronolgy construction program but it was not used in the jasper work i agree that we must be careful not to appear to be knocking other proxies even if this is not intended we must also be explicit about where problems lie and in suggesting the ways to overcome them i for one do not think the world revolves only around trees the only sensible way forward is through interpretation of multiple proxies and we need much more work comparing and reconciling the different evidence they hold lets have more balance in the literature and more constructive dialogue debate between ourselves keith'
